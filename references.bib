  abstract = {There is a shortage of multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up capabilities given the number of transient and variable astrophysical events discovered through wide-field optical surveys such as the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its associated Legacy Survey of Space and Time. From the haystack of potential science targets, astronomers must allocate scarce resources to study a selection of needles in real time. Here we present a variational recurrent autoencoder neural network to encode simulated Rubin Observatory extragalactic transient events using 1\% of the PLAsTiCC data set to train the autoencoder. Our unsupervised method uniquely works with unlabeled, real-time, multivariate, and aperiodic data. We rank 1,129,184 events based on an anomaly score estimated using an isolation forest. We find that our pipeline successfully ranks rarer classes of transients as more anomalous. Using simple cuts in anomaly score and uncertainty, we identify a pure ({$\approx$}95\% pure) sample of rare transients (i.e., transients other than Type Ia, Type II, and Type Ibc supernovae), including superluminous and pair-instability supernovae. Finally, our algorithm is able to identify these transients as anomalous well before peak, enabling real-time follow-up studies in the era of the Rubin Observatory.}

  abstract = {The vision of 2030STEM is to address systemic barriers in institutional structures and funding mechanisms required to achieve full inclusion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and accelerate leadership pathways for individuals from underrepresented populations across STEM sectors. 2030STEM takes a systems-level approach to create a community of practice that affirms diverse cultural identities in STEM. Accelerated systemic change is needed to achieve parity and representation in the STEM workforce, and mentorship - due to its impact on retaining talent - is crucial to ensure those underrepresented in STEM feel that they belong and can thrive. To support the studies and careers of those underrepresented in STEM, we must increase access to mentors who have received adequate training on both the discipline of mentorship in addition to cross-cultural mentoring, use evidence-based mentorship tools to improve the outcomes of mentor/mentee relationships, and create a persistent culture of mentorship at the institutional versus individual level. This white paper provides a summary of research-based mentorship practices that have worked at improving the experience in STEM for underrepresented groups. This is the second in a series of white papers based on 2030STEM Salons that bring together innovative thinkers invested in creating a better STEM world for all. Our first salon focused on the power of social media campaigns like the \#XinSTEM initiatives, to accelerate change towards inclusion and leadership by underrepresented communities in STEM.

  abstract = {A generic prediction of hierarchical clustering models is that the mass function of dark haloes in dense regions in the Universe should be top-heavy. We provide a novel test of this prediction using a sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To perform the test, we compare measurements of galaxy clustering in dense and underdense regions. We find that galaxies in dense regions cluster significantly more strongly than those in less dense regions. This is true over the entire 0.1-30 Mpc pair separation range for which we can make accurate measurements. We make similar measurements in realistic mock catalogues in which the only environmental effects are those which arise from the predicted correlation between halo mass and environment. We also provide an analytic halo model based calculation of the effect. Both the mock catalogues and the analytic calculation provide rather good descriptions of the SDSS measurements. Thus, our results provide strong support for hierarchical models. They suggest that, unless care is taken to study galaxies at fixed mass, correlations between galaxy properties and the surrounding environment are almost entirely due to more fundamental correlations between galaxy properties and host halo mass, and between halo mass and environment. \textcopyright{} 2006 RAS.},

  abstract = {Past and current institutional cultures have contributed to the overrepresentation of white men in geoscience. Acknowledging and learning from this history is critical to building a forward-looking, innovative, and anti-racist geoscience community. To change institutional culture and address inequities and exclusion, the first step for many institutions is to establish a committee or task force focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. In this manuscript, we reflect on our successes, challenges, and experiences co-chairing the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Task Force at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in 2020. We organized a transparent, community-driven effort that lasted for six months with clear expectations around outcomes. We identified priorities, goals, and recommendations for institutional change, ranging from large-scale structural changes to individual actions. Specifically, we found that (1) considering power dynamics, (2) striking a balance between tone and content, (3) addressing how financial constraints intersect with institutional values, and (4) respecting the power and politics of data were critical to our work. Here we present a roadmap for creating robust and visionary institutional change. In addition, we discuss the obstacles, barriers, and opportunities we encountered through our process, in order to provide strategies that other institutions can use to address their own needs, and to advance justice in geoscience as a whole. Moreover, we discuss how this structure and lessons learned are broadly applicable to academic institutions at various scales and beyond geoscience.},

  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ``base {$\Lambda$}CDM'' in this paper). From the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} temperature data combined with \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} = (67.8 {$\pm$} 0.9) km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}Mpc\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, a matter density parameter {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.308 {$\pm$} 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with \emph{n{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{s{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.968 {$\pm$} 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \emph{{$\tau<$}i/{$>$} = 0.066 {$\pm$} 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base {$\Lambda$}CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} observations with other astrophysical data we find \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3.15 {$\pm$} 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {$\sum$} \emph{m{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{{$\nu<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{\emph{K{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} | {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base {$\Lambda$}CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0.002{$<$}sub/{$><$} 0.11, consistent with the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} 2013 results and consistent with the \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$}-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} (BKP) data. Adding the BKP \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$}-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0.002{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}(\emph{{$\varphi<$}i/{$>$}) {$\propto$} \emph{{$\varphi<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} potential. The addition of \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to \emph{w{$<$}i/{$>$} = -1.006 {$\pm$} 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} results for base {$\Lambda$}CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Characterizing the physical properties of the stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) is a key step towards identifying the nature of its possible origin. We focus our analysis on SGWB anisotropies. The existence of a non-trivial primordial scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) correlation in the squeezed configuration may be inferred from the effect that a long wavelength scalar mode has on the gravitational wave power spectrum: an anisotropic contribution. Crucially, such contribution is correlated with temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We show that, for inflationary models that generate suitably large STT non-Gaussianities, cross-correlating the CMB with the stochastic background of gravitational waves is a very effective probe of early universe physics. The resulting signal can be a smoking-gun for primordial SGWB anisotropies.},

  abstract = {Photometric large scale structure (LSS) surveys probe the largest volumes in the Universe, but are inevitably limited by systematic uncertainties. Imperfect photometric calibration leads to biases in our measurements of the density fields of LSS tracers such as galaxies and quasars, and as a result in cosmological parameter estimation. Earlier studies have proposed using cross-correlations between different redshift slices or cross-correlations between different surveys to reduce the effects of such systematics. In this paper we develop a method to characterize unknown systematics. We demonstrate that while we do not have sufficient information to correct for unknown systematics in the data, we can obtain an estimate of their magnitude. We define a parameter to estimate contamination from unknown systematics using cross-correlations between different redshift slices and propose discarding bins in the angular power spectrum that lie outside a certain contamination tolerance level. We show that this method improves estimates of the bias using simulated data and further apply it to photometric luminous red galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a case study. \textcopyright{} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

  abstract = {DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to z = 1.0. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to z = 1.7. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts (2.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5), for the Ly-{$\alpha$} forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median z {$\approx$} 0.2. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions. 2},

  abstract = {We present a public code to generate a mock galaxy catalog in redshift space assuming a log-normal probability density function (PDF) of galaxy and matter density fields. We draw galaxies by Poisson-sampling the log-normal field, and calculate the velocity field from the linearised continuity equation of matter fields, assuming zero vorticity. This procedure yields a PDF of the pairwise velocity fields that is qualitatively similar to that of N-body simulations. We check fidelity of the catalog, showing that the measured two-point correlation function and power spectrum in real space agree with the input precisely. We find that a linear bias relation in the power spectrum does not guarantee a linear bias relation in the density contrasts, leading to a cross-correlation coefficient of matter and galaxies deviating from unity on small scales. We also find that linearising the Jacobian of the real-to-redshift space mapping provides a poor model for the two-point statistics in redshift space. That is, non-linear redshift-space distortion is dominated by non-linearity in the Jacobian. The power spectrum in redshift space shows a damping on small scales that is qualitatively similar to that of the well-known Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect due to random velocities, except that the log-normal mock does not include random velocities. This damping is a consequence of non-linearity in the Jacobian, and thus attributing the damping of the power spectrum solely to FoG, as commonly done in the literature, is misleading.},

K2SC uses Gaussian process regression to model position-dependent systematics and time-dependent variability simultaneously, enabling the user to remove both (e.g., for transit searches) or to remove systematics while preserving variability (for variability studies). For periodic variables, K2SC automatically computes estimates of the period, amplitude and evolution timescale of the variability. We apply K2SC to publicly available K2 data from campaigns 3--5, showing that we obtain photometric precision approaching that of the original Kepler mission. We compare our results to other publicly available K2 pipelines, showing that we obtain similar or better results, on average. We use transit injection and recovery tests to evaluate the impact of K2SC on planetary transit searches in K2 PDC (Pre-search Data Conditioning) data, for planet-to-star radius ratios down Rp/Rstar = 0.01 and periods up to P = 40 d, and show that K2SC significantly improves the ability to distinguish between correct and false detections, particularly for small planets. K2SC can be run automatically on many light curves, or manually tailored for specific objects such as pulsating stars or large amplitude eclipsing binaries. It can be run on ASCII and FITS light curve files, regardless of their origin. Both the code and the processed light curves are publicly available, and we provide instructions for downloading and using them. The methodology used by K2SC will be applicable to future transit search missions such as TESS and PLATO.},

  abstract = {We present the results from the Suzaku satellite of the surrounding region of a galaxy clus-ter, A2744, at z = 0.3. To search for oxygen emission lines from the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), we analyzed X-ray spectra from two northeast regions 2.2\textendash 3.3 and 3.3\textendash{} 4.4 Mpc from the center of the cluster, which offers the first test on the presence of a WHIM near the typical accretion shock radius ({$\sim$} 2r 200) predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. For the 2.2\textendash 3.3 Mpc region, the spectral fit significantly (99.2\% significance) improved when we include O VII and O VIII lines in the spectral model. A comparable WHIM surface bright-ness was obtained in the 3.3\textendash 4.4 Mpc region and the redshift of O VIII line is consistent with z = 0.3 within errors. The present results support that the observed soft X-ray emission orig-inated from the WHIM. However, considering both statistical and systematic uncertainties, O VIII detection in the northeast regions was marginal. The surface brightness of the O VIII line in 10 -7 photons cm -2 s -1 arcmin -2 was measured to be 2.7 {$\pm$} 1.0, 2.1 {$\pm$} 1.2 for the 2.2\textendash 3.3, 3.3\textendash{} 4.4 Mpc regions, giving the upper limit on the baryon overdensity of {$\delta$} = 319({$<$} 443), 283({$<$} 446), respectively. This is comparable with previous observations of cluster outskirts and their the-oretical predictions. The future prospect for WHIM detection using the Athena X-IFU micro-calorimeter is briefly discussed here. In addition, we also derived the ICM temperature distri-bution of A2744 to detect a clear discontinuity at the location of the radio relic. This suggests that the cluster has undergone strong shock heating by mass accretion along the filament.},

The release includes data from 174 nights of observation through 2018 January. The Wide layer data cover about 300 deg2 in all five broad-band filters (grizy) to the nominal survey exposure (10 min in gr and 20 min in izy). Partially observed areas are also included in the release; about 1100 deg2 is observed in at least one filter and one exposure. The median seeing in the i-band is 0.''6, demonstrating the superb image quality of the survey. The Deep (26 deg2) and UltraDeep (4 deg2) data are jointly processed and the UltraDeep-COSMOS field reaches an unprecedented depth of i {$\sim$} 28 at 5 {$\sigma$} for point sources. In addition to the broad-band data, narrow-band data are also available in the Deep and UltraDeep fields. This release includes a major update to the processing pipeline, including improved sky subtraction, PSF modeling, object detection, and artifact rejection. The overall data quality has been improved, but this release is not without problems; there is a persistent deblender problem as well as new issues with masks around bright stars. The user is encouraged to review the issue list before utilizing the data for scientific explorations. All the image products as well as catalog products are available for download. The catalogs are also loaded into a database, which provides an easy interface for users to retrieve data for objects of interest. In addition to these main data products, detailed galaxy shape measurements withheld from Public Data Release 1 (PDR1) are now available to the community. The shape catalog is drawn from the S16A internal release, which has a larger area than PDR1 (160 deg2). All products are available at the data release site, https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection is a classical problem in computer vision, namely the determination of the normal from the abnormal when datasets are highly biased towards one class (normal) due to the insufficient sample size of the other class (abnormal). While this can be addressed as a supervised learning problem, a significantly more challenging problem is that of detecting the unknown/unseen anomaly case that takes us instead into the space of a one-class, semi-supervised learning paradigm. We introduce such a novel anomaly detection model, by using a conditional generative adversarial network that jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference of latent space. Employing encoder-decoder-encoder sub-networks in the generator network enables the model to map the input image to a lower dimension vector, which is then used to reconstruct the generated output image. The use of the additional encoder network maps this generated image to its latent representation. Minimizing the distance between these images and the latent vectors during training aids in learning the data distribution for the normal samples. As a result, a larger distance metric from this learned data distribution at inference time is indicative of an outlier from that distribution\textemdash an anomaly. Experimentation over several benchmark datasets, from varying domains, shows the model efficacy and superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

As background information for Astro2020 white papers, this article summarizes the current design and anticipated performance of WFIRST. While WFIRST does not have the UV imaging/spectroscopic capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, for wide field near-IR surveys WFIRST is hundreds of times more efficient. Some of the most ambitious multi-cycle HST Treasury programs could be executed as routine General Observer (GO) programs on WFIRST. The large area and time-domain surveys planned for the cosmology and exoplanet microlensing programs will produce extraordinarily rich data sets that enable an enormous range of Archival Research (AR) investigations. Requirements for the coronagraph are defined based on its status as a technology demonstration, but its expected performance will enable unprecedented observations of nearby giant exoplanets and circumstellar disks.

  abstract = {We present the cosmological implications from final measurements of clustering using galaxies, quasars, and Ly {$\alpha$} forests from the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) lineage of experiments in large-scale structure. These experiments, composed of data from SDSS, SDSS-II, BOSS, and eBOSS, offer independent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements of angular-diameter distances and Hubble distances relative to the sound horizon, rd, from eight different samples and six measurements of the growth rate parameter, f {$\sigma$}8, from redshift-space distortions (RSD). This composite sample is the most constraining of its kind and allows us to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cosmological model after two decades of dedicated spectroscopic observation. We show that the BAO data alone are able to rule out dark-energy-free models at more than eight standard deviations in an extension to the flat, {$\Lambda$} CDM model that allows for curvature. When combined with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements of temperature and polarization, under the same model, the BAO data provide nearly an order of magnitude improvement on curvature constraints relative to primary CMB constraints alone. Independent of distance measurements, the SDSS RSD data complement weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) in demonstrating a preference for a flat {$\Lambda$} CDM cosmological model when combined with Planck measurements. The combined BAO and RSD measurements indicate {$\sigma$}8=0.85 {$\pm$}0.03 , implying a growth rate that is consistent with predictions from Planck temperature and polarization data and with General Relativity. When combining the results of SDSS BAO and RSD, Planck, Pantheon Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and DES weak lensing and clustering measurements, all multiple-parameter extensions remain consistent with a {$\Lambda$} CDM model. Regardless of cosmological model, the precision on each of the three parameters, {$\Omega\Lambda$}, H0, and {$\sigma$}8, remains at roughly 1\%, showing changes of less than 0.6\% in the central values between models. In a model that allows for free curvature and a time-evolving equation of state for dark energy, the combined samples produce a constraint {$\Omega$}k=-0.0022 {$\pm$}0.0022 . The dark energy constraints lead to w0=-0.909 {$\pm$}0.081 and wa=-0.4 9-0.30+0.35, corresponding to an equation of state of wp=-1.018 {$\pm$}0.032 at a pivot redshift zp=0.29 and a Dark Energy Task Force Figure of Merit of 94. The inverse distance ladder measurement under this model yields H0=68.18 {$\pm$}0.79 km s-1 Mpc-1 , remaining in tension with several direct determination methods; the BAO data allow Hubble constant estimates that are robust against the assumption of the cosmological model. In addition, the BAO data allow estimates of H0 that are independent of the CMB data, with similar central values and precision under a {$\Lambda$} CDM model. Our most constraining combination of data gives the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses at {$\sum$}m{$\nu<$}0.115 eV (95\% confidence). Finally, we consider the improvements in cosmology constraints over the last decade by comparing our results to a sample representative of the period 2000-2010. We compute the relative gain across the five dimensions spanned by w , {$\Omega$}k, {$\sum$}m{$\nu$}, H0, and {$\sigma$}8 and find that the SDSS BAO and RSD data reduce the total posterior volume by a factor of 40 relative to the previous generation. Adding again the Planck, DES, and Pantheon SN Ia samples leads to an overall contraction in the five-dimensional posterior volume of 3 orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data set of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc3, divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51 and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance DM and Hubble parameterHfrom the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method, in combinationwith a cosmic microwave background prior on the sound horizon scale, after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product DMH from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by f{$\sigma$}8(z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine individual measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method; in particular, the AP measurement from sub-BAO scales sharpens constraints from post-reconstruction BAOs by breaking degeneracy between DM and H. Combined with Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature {$\omega$}K = 0.0003 {$\pm$} 0.0026 and a dark energy equation-of-state parameter {$\omega$} =-1.01 {$\pm$} 0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter (CDM) model with a cosmological constant ({$\Lambda$}CDM). Our RSD measurements of f{$\sigma$}8, at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H0 = 67.3 {$\pm$} 1.0 kms-1 Mpc-1 even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H0 = 67.8 {$\pm$} 1.2 kms-1 Mpc-1. Assuming flat {$\Lambda$}CDM, we find {$\omega$}m = 0.310 {$\pm$} 0.005 and H0 = 67.6 {$\pm$} 0.5 kms-1 Mpc-1, and we find a 95 per cent upper limit of 0.16 eV c-2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

Within the next five to ten years, PTAs are expected to detect the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) collectively sourced by inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries. It is expected that this background is mostly isotropic, and current searches focus on the monopole part of the SGWB. Looking ahead, anisotropies in the SGWB may provide a trove of additional information both on known and unknown astrophysical and cosmological sources. In this paper, we build a simple yet realistic Fisher formalism for anisotropic SGWB searches with PTAs. Our formalism is able to accommodate realistic properties of PTAs, and allows simple and accurate forecasts. We illustrate our approach with an idealized PTA consisting of identical, isotropically distributed pulsars. In a companion paper, we apply our formalism to current PTAs and show that it can be a powerful tool to guide and optimize real data analysis.},

  abstract = {Within the next several years pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are positioned to detect the stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) likely produced by the collection of inspiralling super-massive black holes binaries, and potentially constrain some exotic physics. So far most of the pulsar timing data analysis has focused on the monopole of the GWB, assuming it is perfectly isotropic. The natural next step is to search for anisotropies in the GWB. In this paper, we use the recently developed PTA Fisher matrix to gain insights into optimal search strategies for GWB anisotropies. For concreteness, we apply our results to EPTA data, using realistic noise characteristics of its pulsars. We project the detectability of a GWB whose angular dependence is assumed to be a linear combination of predetermined maps, such as spherical harmonics or coarse pixels. We find that the GWB monopole is always statistically correlated with these maps, implying a loss of sensitivity to the monopole when searching simultaneously for anisotropies. We then derive the angular distributions of the GWB intensity to which a PTA is most sensitive, and illustrate how one may use these "principal maps" to approximately reconstruct the angular dependence of the GWB. Since the principal maps are neither perfectly anisotropic nor uncorrelated with the monopole, we also develop a frequentist criterion to specifically search for anisotropies in the GWB without any prior knowledge about their angular distribution. Lastly, we show how to recover existing EPTA results with our Fisher formalism, and clarify their meaning. The tools presented here will be valuable in guiding and optimizing the computationally demanding analyses of pulsar timing data.},

For emulating spectra, we use principal component analysis to construct a set of basis functions, and neural networks to learn the basis coefficients as a function of the SPS model parameters. For photometry, we parameterize the magnitudes (for the filters of interest) as a function of SPS parameters by a neural network. The resulting emulators are able to predict spectra and photometry under both simple and complicated SPS model parameterizations to percent-level accuracy, giving a factor of \$10\^3\$--\$10\^4\$ speed up over direct SPS computation. They have readily-computable derivatives, making them amenable to gradient-based inference and optimization methods. The emulators are also straightforward to call from a GPU, giving an additional order-of-magnitude speed-up. Rapid SPS computations delivered by emulation offers a massive reduction in the computational resources required to infer the physical properties of galaxies from observed spectra or photometry and simulate galaxy populations under SPS models, whilst maintaining the accuracy required for a range of applications.},

Euclid will explore the expansion history of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and red-shifts of galaxies as well as the distribution of clusters of galaxies over a large fraction of the sky. Although the main driver for Euclid is the nature of dark energy, Euclid science covers a vast range of topics, from cosmology to galaxy evolution to planetary research. In this review we focus on cosmology and fundamental physics, with a strong emphasis on science beyond the current standard models. We discuss five broad topics: dark energy and modified gravity, dark matter, initial conditions, basic assumptions and questions of methodology in the data analysis. This review has been planned and carried out within Euclid's Theory Working Group and is meant to provide a guide to the scientific themes that will underlie the activity of the group during the preparation of the Euclid mission.},

  abstract = {Euclid is an ESA Cosmic-Vision wide-field-space mission which is designed to explain the origin of the acceleration of Universe expansion. The mission will investigate at the same time two primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Galaxy Clustering (in particular Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO). The extreme precision requested on primary science objectives can only be achieved by observing a large number of galaxies distributed over the whole sky in order to probe the distribution of dark matter and galaxies at all scales. The extreme accuracy needed requires observation from space to limit all observational biases in the measurements. The definition of the Euclid survey, aiming at detecting billions of galaxies over 15 000 square degrees of the extragalactic sky, is a key parameter of the mission. It drives its scientific potential, its duration and the mass of the spacecraft. The construction of a Reference Survey derives from the high level science requirements for a Wide and a Deep survey. The definition of a main sequence of observations and the associated calibrations were indeed a major achievement of the Definition Phase. Implementation of this sequence demonstrated the feasibility of covering the requested area in less than 6 years while taking into account the overheads of space segment observing and maneuvering sequence. This reference mission will be used for sizing the spacecraft consumables needed for primary science. It will also set the framework for optimizing the time on the sky to fulfill the primary science and maximize the Euclid legacy.},

  abstract = {In a purely cold dark matter universe, the initial matter power spectrum and its subsequent gravitational growth contain no special mass- or time-scales, and so neither do the emergent population statistics of internal dark matter (DM) halo properties. Using 1.5 million halos from three IllustrisTNG realizations of a LambdaCDM universe, we show that galaxy formation physics drives non-monotonic features ("wiggles") into DM property statistics across six decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. We characterize these features by extracting the halo mass-dependent statistics of five DM halo properties -- velocity dispersion, NFW concentration, density- and velocity-space shapes, and formation time -- using kernel-localized linear regression (KLLR). Comparing precise estimates of normalizations, slopes, and covariances between realizations with and without galaxy formation, we find systematic deviations across all mass-scales, with maximum deviations of 25\% at the Milky-Way mass of 1e12 Msun. The mass-dependence of the wiggles is set by the interplay between different cooling and feedback mechanisms, and we discuss its observational implications. The property covariances depend strongly on halo mass and physics treatment, but the correlations are mostly robust. Using multivariate KLLR and interpretable machine learning, we show the halo concentration and velocity-space shape are principal contributors, at different mass, to the velocity dispersion variance. Statistics of mass accretion rate and DM surface pressure energy are provided in an appendix. We publicly release halo property catalogs and KLLR parameters for the TNG runs at twenty epochs up to z = 12.},

Assuming a concordance {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc 3 , and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, \textasciimacron{} n {$\approx$} 3 \texttimes{} 10 -4 h -3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5{$\sigma$} in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II Luminous Red Galaxy Sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7{$\sigma$}. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon D V /r s = 13.67 {$\pm$} 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance D V (z = 0.57) = 2094 {$\pm$} 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

  abstract = {We present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the detections of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of over 7{$\sigma$} in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 {$\pm$} 25 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.32 and DV = (2056 {$\pm$} 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at z = 0.57 of DA = (1421 {$\pm$} 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) and H = (96.8 {$\pm$} 3.4 kms-1 Mpc-1)(rd,fid/rd). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwave background data for a spatially flat CDM model with a cosmological constant. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {We reconsider the ellipsoidal-collapse model and extend it in two ways: we modify the treatment of the external gravitational shear field, introducing a hybrid model in between linear and non-linear evolution, and we introduce a virialisation criterion derived from the tensor virial theorem to replace the ad hoc criterion employed so far. We compute the collapse parameters {$\delta\_$}c and {$\Delta\_$}v and find that they increase with ellipticity e and decrease with prolaticity p. We marginalise them over the appropriate distribution of e and p and show the marginalised results as functions of halo mass and virialisation redshift. While the hybrid model for the external shear gives results very similar to those obtained from the non-linear model, ellipsoidal collapse changes the collapse parameters typically by (20 ldots 50)\%, in a way increasing with decreasing halo mass and decreasing virialisation redshift. We qualitatively confirm the dependence on mass and virialisation redshift of a fitting formula for {$\delta\_$}c, but find noticeable quantitative differences in particular at low mass and high redshift. The derived mass function is in good agreement with mass functions recently proposed in the literature.},

  abstract = {Most treatments of large scale anomalies in the microwave sky are a posteriori , with unquantified look-elsewhere effects. We contrast these with physical models of specific inhomogeneities in the early Universe which can generate these apparent anomalies. Physical models predict correlations between candidate anomalies and the corresponding signals in polarization and large scale structure, reducing the impact of cosmic variance. We compute the apparent spatial curvature associated with large-scale inhomogeneities and show that it is typically small, allowing for a self-consistent analysis. As an illustrative example we show that a single large plane wave inhomogeneity can contribute to low-l mode alignment and odd-even asymmetry in the power spectra and the best-fit model accounts for a significant part of the claimed odd-even asymmetry. We argue that this approach can be generalized to provide a more quantitative assessment of potential large scale anomalies in the Universe. Planck [1] and WMAP [2] yield independent, consis-tent maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). At large scales the main origin of uncertainty is the fi-nite size of the visible Universe, rather than instrumen-tal sensitivity or integrated observing time. Many CMB anomalies have been described [3\textendash 14], including low-l mode alignments or " axis of evil " , cold spot, hemispher-ical asymmetry, and parity asymmetry. These analyses are a posteriori and subject to large, unquantified " look-elsewhere " effects, and correlations between candidate anomalies are unknown. Further, p values and similar tests are often used to assess the significance of anoma-lies [4], even though we cannot observe an ensemble of microwave skies. By contrast, a physical mechanism that generates large-scale anisotropy will also predict the correlations between candidate anomalies, including those for which a search of our sky yields a null result, along with the associated polarization pattern. As an illustrative exam-ple, we analyze a model with a single amplified Fourier mode, showing this can generate low-l mode alignments and parity asymmetry in the CMB [4]. We compute the expected curvature {$\Omega$} K generated by a large perturbation [15], finding that perturbations large enough to generate anomalies in the CMB do not also generate an apparent spatial curvature. We work within the broad inflationary paradigm, but similar arguments could be made in other scenarios. Assume for simplicity that the perturbations have the Bunch-Davies form [16], the Hubble parameter H {$\approx$} const, and the spectral index n s = 1. Single-field in-flation [16] with gauge-invariant curvature perturbations {$\zeta$} on uniform density hypersurfaces has the Mukhanov variable v {$\equiv$} z{$\zeta$}, z 2 {$\equiv$} a},

We consider a sample of 147,000 quasars from the ex-tended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) distributed over 2044 square de-grees with redshifts 0.8 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2 and measure their spherically-averaged clustering in both configuration and Fourier space. Our observational dataset and the 1400 simulated re-alizations of the dataset allow us to detect a preference for BAO that is greater than 2.8{$\sigma$}. We determine the spherically averaged BAO distance to z = 1.52 to 3.8 per cent precision: D V (z = 1.52) = 3843 {$\pm$} 147 (r d /r d,fid) Mpc. This is the first time the location of the BAO feature has been measured between redshifts 1 and 2. Our result is fully consistent with the prediction obtained by extrapolating the Planck flat {$\Lambda$}CDM best-fit cosmology. All of our results are consistent with basic large-scale structure (LSS) theory, confirming quasars to be a reliable tracer of LSS, and provide a starting point for numerous cosmological tests to be performed with eBOSS quasar samples. We combine our result with previous, independent, BAO distance measurements to construct an updated BAO distance-ladder. Using these BAO data alone and marginalizing over the length of the standard ruler, we find {$\Omega$} {$\Lambda$} {$>$} 0 at 6.6{$\sigma$} significance when testing a {$\Lambda$}CDM model with free curvature.},

We find evidence for outflows in 322 galaxies (\$12\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ of the analysed line-emitting sample), 185 of which show evidence for hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Most outflows are centrally concentrated with a spatial extent that scales sublinearly with Re. The incidence of outflows is enhanced at higher masses, central surface densities, and deeper gravitational potentials, as well as at higher star formation rate (SFR) and AGN luminosity. We quantify strong correlations between mass outflow rates and the mechanical drivers of the outflow of the form \$\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash rm out\} \textbackslash propto \textbackslash rm SFR\^\{0.97\}\$ and \$\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash rm out\} \textbackslash propto L\_\{\textbackslash rm AGN\}\^\{0.55\}\$. We derive a master scaling relation describing the mass outflow rate of ionized gas as a function of M{$\star$}, SFR, Re, and LAGN. Most of the observed winds are anticipated to act as galactic fountains, with the fraction of galaxies with escaping winds increasing with decreasing potential well depth. We further investigate the physical properties of the outflowing gas finding evidence for enhanced attenuation in the outflow, possibly due to metal-enriched winds, and higher excitation compared to the gas in the galactic disc. Given that the majority of previous studies have focused on more extreme systems with higher SFRs and/or more luminous AGN, our study provides a unique view of the non-gravitational gaseous motions within `typical' galaxies in the low-redshift Universe, where low-luminosity AGN and star formation contribute jointly to the observed outflow phenomenology.},

  abstract = {In this conceptual paper, I put forward an argument about the conceptualization of science identity as a landscape of becoming by placing emphasis on recognition and emotions, as core features of identity, through an intersectionality lens. These constructs intertwined, I argue, can give meaning to the process of becoming a science person or forming a science identity, and at the same time shed light on issues related to power, inequality, racism, and exclusion. In the context of these bigger issues, I argue that forming a science identity is not only personal, but also political. The need for intersectionality as a conceptual framework for studying science identity is underscored by the dearth of theory and empirical evidence that addresses classroom inequalities, as well as the multiple and interlocking influence of systems of privilege and oppression in science, such as racism and sexism. Recognition, which refers to how individuals are recognized by others as certain kinds of people, is an ineradicable part of our social world; it is bound within sociopolitical contexts and tied to specific cultural norms, values, beliefs, and stereotypes. Hence, recognition becomes of paramount importance in science identity research. However, critical questions still remain unanswered, such as who is allowed in the world of science and who is recognized as a science person in specific contexts? Directly linked to recognition, I argue, are different types of emotions which can offer a valuable lens for studying inequalities within the process of forming a science identity. What this means for science identity research is how important it is to explore the emotionality of science identity given that emotions are not just dialectically related but inextricably bound with (mis)recognition as well as with various systems of oppression.},

  abstract = {With the advent of surveys containing millions to billions of galaxies, it is imperative to develop analysis techniques that utilize the available statistical power. In galaxy clustering, even small sample contamination arising from distance uncertainties can lead to large artifacts, which the standard es-timator does not account for. We first introduce a formalism, termed decontamination, that corrects for sample contamination by utilizing the observed cross-correlations in the contaminated samples; this corrects any correlation function estimator for contamination. Using this formalism, we present a new estimator that uses the standard estimator to measure correlation functions in the contaminated samples but then corrects for contamination. We also introduce a weighted estimator that assigns each galaxy a weight in each redshift bin based on its probability of being in that bin. We demonstrate that these estimators effectively recover the true correlation functions and their covariance matrices. Our estimators can correct for sample contamination caused by misclassification between object types as well as photometric redshifts; they should be particularly helpful for studies of galaxy evolution and baryonic acoustic oscillations, where forward-modeling the clustering signal using the contaminated redshift distribution is undesirable.},

  abstract = {We construct a supervised classifier based on Gaussian Mixture Models to probabilistically classify objects in Gaia data release 2 (GDR2) using only photometric and astrometric data in that release. The model is trained empirically to classify objects into three classes -- star, quasar, galaxy -- for G{$<$}=14.5 mag down to the Gaia magnitude limit of G=21.0 mag. Galaxies and quasars are identified for the training set by a cross-match to objects with spectroscopic classifications from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Stars are defined directly from GDR2. When allowing for the expectation that quasars are 500 times rarer than stars, and galaxies 7500 times rarer than stars (the class imbalance problem), samples classified with a threshold probability of 0.5 are predicted to have purities of 0.43 for quasars and 0.28 for galaxies, and completenesses of 0.58 and 0.72 respectively. The purities can be increased up to 0.60 by adopting a higher threshold. Not accounting for this expected low frequency of extragalactic objects (the class prior) would give both erroneously optimistic performance predictions and severely impure samples. Applying our model to all 1.20 billion objects in GDR2 with the required features, we classify 2.3 million objects as quasars and 0.37 million objects as galaxies (with individual probabilities above 0.5). The small number of galaxies is due to the strong bias of the satellite detection algorithm and on-ground data selection against extended objects. We infer the true number of quasars and galaxies -- as these classes are defined by our training set -- to be 690,000 and 110,000 respectively (+/- 50\%). The aim of this work is to see how well extragalactic objects can be classified using only GDR2 data. Better classifications should be possible with the low resolution spectroscopy (BP/RP) planned for GDR3.},

Most of the forecasts for cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering studies rely on the Fisher matrix approach for large-scale experiments like DES, Euclid, or SKA. Here we improve upon the standard method by taking into account three effects: the finite window function, the correlation between redshift bins, and the uncertainty on the bin redshift. The first two effects are negligible only in the limit of infinite surveys. The third effect, on the contrary, is negligible for infinitely small bins. Here we show how to take into account these effects and what the impact on forecasts of a Euclid-type experiment will be. The main result of this article is that the windowing and the bin cross-correlation induce a considerable change in the forecasted errors, of the order of 10-30\% for most cosmological parameters, while the redshift bin uncertainty can be neglected for bins smaller than {$\increment$}z = 0.1 roughly.},

Recently, \$k\$-Nearest Neighbor Cumulative Distribution Functions (\$k\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\$-\$\{\textbackslash rm CDF\}\$) were shown to be sensitive probes of cosmological (auto) clustering. In this paper, we extend the framework of nearest neighbor measurements to describe joint distributions of, and correlations between, two datasets. We describe the measurement of joint \$k\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\$-\$\{\textbackslash rm CDF\}\$s, and show that these measurements are sensitive to all possible connected \$N\$-point functions that can be defined in terms of the two datasets. We describe how the cross-correlations can be isolated by combining measurements of the joint \$k\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\$-\$\{\textbackslash rm CDF\}\$s and those measured from individual datasets. We demonstrate the application of these measurements in the context of Gaussian density fields, as well as for fully nonlinear cosmological datasets. Using a Fisher analysis, we show that measurements of the halo-matter cross-correlations, as measured through nearest neighbor measurements are more sensitive to the underlying cosmological parameters, compared to traditional two-point cross-correlation measurements over the same range of scales. Finally, we demonstrate how the nearest neighbor cross-correlations can robustly detect cross correlations between sparse samples -- the same regime where the two-point cross-correlation measurements are dominated by noise.},

  abstract = {The use of summary statistics beyond the two-point correlation function to analyse the non-Gaussian clustering on small scales, and thereby, increasing the sensitivity to the underlying cosmological parameters, is an active field of research in cosmology. In this paper, we explore a set of new summary statistics - the k-Nearest Neighbour Cumulative Distribution Functions (kNN-CDF). This is the empirical cumulative distribution function of distances from a set of volume-filling, Poisson distributed random points to the k-nearest data points, and is sensitive to all connected N-point correlations in the data. The kNN-CDF can be used to measure counts in cell, void probability distributions, and higher N-point correlation functions, all using the same formalism exploiting fast searches with spatial tree data structures. We demonstrate how it can be computed efficiently from various data sets - both discrete points, and the generalization for continuous fields. We use data from a large suite of N-body simulations to explore the sensitivity of this new statistic to various cosmological parameters, compared to the two-point correlation function, while using the same range of scales. We demonstrate that the use of kNN-CDF improves the constraints on the cosmological parameters by more than a factor of 2 when applied to the clustering of dark matter in the range of scales between 10 and 40, h-1 Mpc. We also show that relative improvement is even greater when applied on the same scales to the clustering of haloes in the simulations at a fixed number density, both in real space, as well as in redshift space. Since the kNN-CDF are sensitive to all higher order connected correlation functions in the data, the gains over traditional two-point analyses are expected to grow as progressively smaller scales are included in the analysis of cosmological data, provided the higher order correlation functions are sensitive to cosmology on the scales of interest.},

We find galaxies with high ionisation lines, galaxies which host supernovae, and galaxies with unusual gas kinematics. Only a fraction of the outliers we find were reported by previous studies that used specific and tailored algorithms to find a single class of unusual objects. Our algorithm is general and detects all of these classes, and many more, regardless of what makes them peculiar.

On large scales (k 0.1 Mpc -1) this can mostly be characterized by evolution in the product of the mean 21 cm brightness temperature and a bias factor, T 21 b 21 (z). This quantity evolves in a distinctive way that can help in determining the average ionization history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) from upcoming 21 cm fluctuation data sets. Here we consider extracting T 21 b 21 (z) using a combination of future redshifted 21 cm and [CII] line-intensity mapping data sets. Our method exploits the dependence of the 21 cm-[CII]-[CII] cross-bispectrum on the shape of triangle configurations in Fourier space. This allows one to determine T 21 b 21 (z) yet, importantly, is less sensitive to foreground contamination than the 21 cm auto-spectrum, and so can provide a valuable cross-check. We compare the results of simulated bispectra with second-order perturbation theory: on the largest scales well-probed by our simulations (k {$\sim$} 0.05 Mpc -1), the perturbative estimate of T 21 b 21 matches the true value to within 10\% for x i 0.8. The perturbative formula is most accurate early in the EoR. We consider the 21 cm auto-bispectrum and show that this statistic may also be used to extract the 21 cm bias factor. Finally, we discuss the survey requirements for measuring the cross-bispectrum. Although we focus on the 21 cm-[CII]-[CII] bispectrum during reionization, our method may be of broader interest and can be applied to any two fields throughout cosmic history.

The resulting catalogue has 354\,590\,570 objects, significantly fewer than the parent PS1 catalogue, but its combination of optical and infrared colours facilitate both better source classification and photometric redshift estimation. We perform a neural network-based classification of the objects into galaxies, quasars, and stars, then run neural network-based photometric redshift estimation for the galaxies. The star sample purity and quasar sample completeness measures improve substantially, and the resulting photo-z's are significantly more accurate in terms of statistical scatter and bias than those calculated from PS1 properties alone. The catalogue will be a basis for future large-scale structure studies, and will be made available as a high-level science product via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.},

  abstract = {In recent years, dedicated extreme-precision radial velocity (EPRV) spectrographs have produced vast quantities of high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise time-series spectra for bright stars. These data contain valuable information for the dual purposes of planet detection via the measured RVs and stellar characterization via the co-added spectra. However, considerable data analysis challenges exist in extracting these data products from the observed spectra at the highest possible precision, including the issue of poorly-characterized telluric absorption features and the common use of an assumed stellar spectral template. In both of these examples, precision-limiting reliance on external information can be sidestepped using the data directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously extract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and telluric spectra using a linear model (in the log of flux). The model employs a convex objective and convex regularization to keep the optimization of the spectral components fast. We implement this method in wobble, an open-source python package which uses TensorFlow in one of its first non-neural-network applications to astronomical data. In this work, we demonstrate the performance of wobble on archival HARPS spectra. We recover the canonical exoplanet 51 Pegasi b, detect the secular RV evolution of the M dwarf Barnard's Star, and retrieve the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the Hot Jupiter HD 189733b. The method additionally produces extremely high-S/N composite stellar spectra and detailed time-variable telluric spectra, which we also present here.},

Our algorithm has demonstrated the ability to improve both the completeness (through detecting and inserting otherwise missing halos) and purity (through detecting and removing spurious objects) of both merger trees and halo catalogs. In addition, our method is able to robustly measure the self-consistency of halo finders; it is the first to directly measure the uncertainties in halo positions, halo velocities, and the halo mass function for a given halo finder based on consistency between snapshots in cosmological simulations. We use this algorithm to generate merger trees for two large simulations (Bolshoi and Consuelo) and evaluate two halo finders (rockstar and bdm). We find that both the rockstar and bdm halo finders track halos extremely well; in both, the number of halos which do not have physically consistent progenitors is at the 1\%\textendash 2\% level across all halo masses.

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for identifying dark matter halos, substructure, and tidal features. The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named Rockstar (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 10\^5 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ({$>$}10\^10 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper (Knebe et al 2011) has shown Rockstar to have class-leading recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery as compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results which demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or satellite average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km/s at z=0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar .},

  abstract = {How does the clustering of galaxies depend on their inner properties like morphological type and luminosity? We address this question in the mathematical framework of marked point processes and clarify the notion of luminosity and morphological segregation. A number of test quantities such as conditional mark-weighted two-point correlation functions are introduced. These descriptors allow for a scale-dependent analysis of luminosity and morphology segregation. Moreover, they break the degeneracy between an inhomogeneous fractal point set and actual present luminosity segregation. Using the Southern Sky Redshift Survey\textasciitilde 2 (da Costa et al. 1998, SSRS2) we find both luminosity and morphological segregation at a high level of significance, confirming claims by previous works using these data (Benoist et al. 1996, Willmer et al. 1998). Specifically, the average luminosity and the fluctuations in the luminosity of pairs of galaxies are enhanced out to separations of 15Mpc/h. On scales smaller than 3Mpc/h the luminosities on galaxy pairs show a tight correlation. A comparison with the random-field model indicates that galaxy luminosities depend on the spatial distribution and galaxy-galaxy interactions. Early-type galaxies are also more strongly correlated, indicating morphological segregation. The galaxies in the PSCz catalog (Saunders et al. 2000) do not show significant luminosity segregation. This again illustrates that mainly early-type galaxies contribute to luminosity segregation. However, based on several independent investigations we show that the observed luminosity segregation can not be explained by the morphology-density relation alone.},

  abstract = {Halo models provide a simple and computationally inexpensive way to investigate the connection between galaxies and their dark matter haloes. However, these models rely on the assumption that the role of baryons can easily be parametrized in the modelling procedure. We aim to examine the ability of halo occupation distribution (HOD) modelling to reproduce the galaxy clustering found in two different hydrodynamic simulations, Illustris and EAGLE. For each simulation, we measure several galaxy clustering statistics on two different luminosity threshold samples. We then apply a simple five parameter HOD, which was fit to each simulation separately, to the corresponding dark matter-only simulations, and measure the same clustering statistics. We find that the halo mass function is shifted to lower masses in the hydrodynamic simulations, resulting in a galaxy number density that is too high when an HOD is applied to the dark matter-only simulation. However, the exact way in which baryons alter the mass function is remarkably different in the two simulations. After applying a correction to the halo mass function in each simulation, the HOD is able to accurately reproduce all clustering statistics for the high luminosity sample of galaxies. For the low luminosity sample, we find evidence that in addition to correcting the halo mass function, including spatial, velocity, and assembly bias parameters in the HOD is necessary to accurately reproduce clustering statistics.},

  abstract = {We investigate galaxy bias in the framework of the ``Halo Occupation Distribution'' (HOD), which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by the conditional probability P(N|M) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies, together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of P(N|M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of xi(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical and semi-analytic models in reproducing this form is entirely non-trivial. Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion, and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias. We outline a strategy for determining the HOD empirically from redshift survey data. This method starts from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that cosmological and HOD parameters will have non-degenerate effects on galaxy clustering, so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical determinations of the HOD as a function of galaxy type from the 2dF and SDSS redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation, insight into the origin of galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological models.},

We then cover the basic statistical tools used in cosmology to describe cosmic fields, such as correlations functions in real and Fourier space, probability distribution functions, cumulants and generating functions. In subsequent sections we review the use of PT to make quantitative predictions about these statistics according to initial conditions, including effects of possible non Gaussianity of the primordial fields. Results are illustrated by detailed comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections deal with applications to observations. First we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to weak gravitational lensing. We finally review the current observational situation regarding statistics in galaxy catalogs and what the future generation of galaxy surveys promises to deliver.},

We include an interaction term, through which the energy of the scalar field is transferred to the matter fields, consistent with a term that arises from scalar-tensor theory under a conformal transformation and field redefinition. The governing ordinary differential equations reduce to a dynamical system when appropriate normalized variables are defined. We analyze the dynamical system and find that the interaction term can significantly affect the qualitative behavior of the models. The late-time behavior of these models may be of cosmological interest. In particular, for a specific range of values for the model parameters there are late-time attracting solutions, corresponding to a novel attracting equilibrium point, which are inflationary and in which the scalar field's energy-density remains a fixed fraction of the matter field's energy density. These scalar field models may be of interest as late-time cosmologies, particularly in view of the recent observations of the current accelerated cosmic expansion. For appropriate values of the interaction coupling parameter, this equilibrium point is an attracting focus, and hence as inflating solutions approach this late-time attractor the scalar field oscillates. Hence these models may also be of importance in the study of inflation in the early universe. \textcopyright{} 2000 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {Observations indicate galaxies are distributed in a filament-dominated web-like structure. Numerical experiments at high and low redshift of viable structure formation theories also show filament-dominance. We present a simple quantitative explanation of why this is so, showing that the final-state web is actually present in embryonic form in the overdensity pattern of the initial fluctuations, with nonlinear dynamics just sharpening the image. The web is largely defined by the position and primordial tidal fields of rare events in the medium, with the strongest filaments between nearby clusters whose tidal tensors are nearly aligned. Applications of the cosmic web theory to observations include probing cluster-cluster bridges by weak gravitational lensing, X-rays, and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and probing high redshift galaxy-galaxy bridges by low column density Lyman alpha absorption lines.},

We use the same models to mimic the density profile of \$N\$-body haloes, showing that their MFs clearly differ as sensitive to internal substructures. This highlights the benefit of MFs at the halo scales as promising statistics to improve the spatial modeling of dark matter, crucial for future lensing, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich, and X-ray mass maps as well as dark matter detection based on high-accuracy data.},

These galaxies span a range of stellar masses (9.45{$<$} log[M*/Msun]{$<$}10.7) and star formation rates (0.14 {$<$} log [SFR/Msun/yr] {$<$} 2.35). We identify the cool outflowing component in the MgII absorption and find that the equivalent width of the outflowing component increases with stellar mass. The outflow equivalent width also increases steadily with the increasing star formation rate of the galaxies. At similar stellar masses the blue galaxies exhibit a significantly higher outflow equivalent width as compared to red galaxies. The outflow equivalent width shows strong effect with star formation surface density (\{\textbackslash Sigma\}SFR) of the sample. For the disk galaxies, the outflow equivalent width is higher for the face-on systems as compared to the edge-on ones, indicating that for the disk galaxies, the outflowing gas is primarily bipolar in geometry. Galaxies typically exhibit outflow velocities ranging from -200 km/s to -300 km/s and on average the face-on galaxies exhibit higher outflow velocity as compared to the edge-on ones. Galaxies with irregular morphologies exhibit outflow equivalent width as well as outflow velocities comparable to face on disk galaxies. These galaxies exhibit minimum mass outflow rates {$>$} 5-7 Msun/yr and a mass loading factor (\{\textbackslash eta\} = dMout/dt /SFR) comparable to the star formation rates of the galaxies.},

We investigate the variation of Mg II rest-frame equivalent width (EW) as a function of the radial impact parameter for different subsets of foreground galaxies selected in terms of their rest-frame colors and masses. Blue galaxies have a significantly higher average Mg II EW at close galactocentric radii as compared to the red galaxies. Among the blue galaxies, there is a correlation between Mg II EW and galactic stellar mass of the host galaxy. We also find that the distribution of Mg II absorption around group galaxies is more extended than that for non-group galaxies, and that groups as a whole have more extended radial profiles than individual galaxies. Interestingly, these effects can be satisfactorily modeled by a simple superposition of the absorption profiles of individual member galaxies, assuming that these are the same as those of non-group galaxies, suggesting that the group environment may not significantly enhance or diminish the Mg II absorption of individual galaxies. We show that there is a strong azimuthal dependence of the Mg II absorption within 50 kpc of inclined disk-dominated galaxies, indicating the presence of a strongly bipolar outflow aligned along the disk rotation axis. There is no significant dependence of Mg II absorption on the apparent inclination angle of disk-dominated galaxies.

From the projected 1D and 2D distribution of C IV absorption, we find that C IV absorption is detected out to \textasciitilde{} 0.5 R\$\_\{vir\}\$ of the host galaxies. The C IV absorption strength falls off radially as a power law and beyond 0.5 R\$\_\{vir\}\$, no C IV absorption is detected above our sensitivity limit of \textasciitilde{} 50-100 m\$\textbackslash AA\$. We find a tentative correlation between detected C IV absorption strength and star formation, paralleling the strong correlation seen in highly ionized oxygen for L\textasciitilde L* galaxies by the COS-Halos survey. The data imply a large carbon reservoir in the CGM of these galaxies, corresponding to a minimum carbon mass of \$\textbackslash gtrsim\$ 1.2\$\textbackslash times 10\^6\$ \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ out to \textasciitilde{} 110 kpc. This mass is comparable to the carbon mass in the ISM and more than the carbon mass currently in stars of these galaxies. The C IV absorption seen around these sub-L* galaxies can account for almost two-thirds of all \$W\_r\${$>$} 100 m\$\textbackslash AA\$ C IV absorption detected at low z. Comparing the C IV covering fraction with hydrodynamical simulations, we find that an energy-driven wind model is consistent with the observations whereas a wind model of constant velocity fails to reproduce the CGM or the galaxy properties.},

The radial distribution of equivalent widths is relatively uniform for the blue galaxies, but highly patchy (low covering fraction) for the red galaxies. We also find that the Lyman\textasciitilde\$\textbackslash alpha\$ and Si III equivalent widths show significant positive correlations with the specific star-formation rate (sSFR) of the galaxy. We find a surprising lack of correlations between the halo mass (virial velocity) and either the velocity dispersions or velocity offsets of the Lyman\textasciitilde\$\textbackslash alpha\$ lines. The ratio of the velocity offset to the velocity dispersion for the Lyman\textasciitilde\$\textbackslash alpha\$ absorbers has a mean value of \$\textbackslash sim\$ 4, suggesting that a given the line-of-sight is intersecting a dynamically coherent structure in the CGM rather than a sea of orbiting clouds. The kinematic properties of the CGM are similar in the blue and red galaxies, although we find that a significantly larger fraction of the blue galaxies have large Lyman\textasciitilde\$\textbackslash alpha\$ velocity offsets ({$>$}200 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$).

The MS-II assumes the same cosmological parameters and uses the same particle number and output data structure as the original Millennium Simulation (MS), but was carried out in a periodic cube one-fifth the size (100h-1Mpc) with five times better spatial resolution (a Plummer equivalent softening of 1.0h-1kpc) and with 125 times better mass resolution (a particle mass of 6.9 \texttimes{} 106h-1Msolar). By comparing results at MS and MS-II resolution, we demonstrate excellent convergence in dark matter statistics such as the halo mass function, the subhalo abundance distribution, the mass dependence of halo formation times, the linear and non-linear autocorrelations and power spectra, and halo assembly bias. Together, the two simulations provide precise results for such statistics over an unprecedented range of scales, from haloes similar to those hosting Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies to haloes corresponding to the richest galaxy clusters. The `Milky Way' haloes of the Aquarius Project were selected from a lower resolution version of the MS-II and were then resimulated at much higher resolution. As a result, they are present in the MS-II along with thousands of other similar mass haloes. A comparison of their assembly histories in the MS-II and in resimulations of 1000 times better resolution shows detailed agreement over a factor of 100 in mass growth. We publicly release halo catalogues and assembly trees for the MS-II in the same format within the same archive as those already released for the MS.},

  abstract = {Recent cosmological analyses (e.g., JLA, Pantheon) of Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) have propagated systematic uncertainties into a covariance matrix and either binned or smoothed the systematic vectors in redshift space. We demonstrate that systematic error budgets of these analyses can be improved by a factor of \$\textbackslash sim1.5\textbackslash times\$ with the use of unbinned and unsmoothed covariance matrices. To understand this, we employ a separate approach that simultaneously fits for cosmological parameters and additional self-calibrating scale parameters that constrain the size of each systematic. We show that the covariance-matrix approach and scale-parameter approach yield equivalent results, implying that in both cases the data can self-calibrate certain systematic uncertainties, but that this ability is hindered when information is binned or smoothed in redshift space. We review the top systematic uncertainties in current analyses and find that the reduction of systematic uncertainties in the unbinned case depends on whether a systematic is consistent with varying the cosmological model and whether or not the systematic can be described by additional correlations between SN properties and luminosity. Furthermore, we show that the power of self-calibration increases with the size of the dataset, which presents a tremendous opportunity for upcoming analyses of photometrically classified samples, like those of Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (NGRST). However, to take advantage of self-calibration in large, photometrically-classified samples, we must first address the issue that binning is required in currently-used photometric methodologies.},

The comparison is made for a large number of clusters at a range of redshifts in three different cosmological models (cold plus hot dark matter, cold dark matter, and open cold dark matter). We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed passband, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

Utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volume limited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from the SDSS galaxy catalog. In the largest such analysis to date, we study the angular clustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. Using Limber's equation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set as r0=5.77+/-0.10 Mpc/h. We find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of 1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshift surveys. We also find that both the clustering length and the slope of the correlation function depend on the galaxy type. In particular, by splitting the galaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior in their clustering properties. Galaxies with spectral types similar to elliptical galaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 Mpc/h and a slope of the angular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have a clustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 Mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. The two intermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', rather than showing a gradual transition in slope. We discuss these correlations in the context of current cosmological models for structure formation.},

  abstract = {During the first three observing runs of the Advanced gravitational-wave detector network, the LIGO/Virgo collaboration detected several black hole binary (BHBH) mergers. As the population of detected BHBH mergers grows, it will become possible to constrain different channels for their formation. Here we consider the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) channel in close binaries, by performing population synthesis simulations that combine realistic binary models with detailed cosmological calculations of the chemical and star-formation history of the Universe. This allows us to constrain population properties, as well as cosmological and aLIGO detection rates of BHBH mergers formed through this pathway. We predict a BHBH merger rate at redshift zero of \$5.8 \textbackslash hspace\{1mm\} \textbackslash textrm\{Gpc\}\^\{-3\} \textbackslash textrm\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$ through the CHE channel, to be compared with aLIGO's measured rate of \$\{53.2\}\_\{-28.2\}\^\{+55.8\} \textbackslash hspace\{1mm\} \textbackslash text\{Gpc\}\^\{-3\}\textbackslash text\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$, and find that eventual merger systems have BH masses in the range \$17 - 43 \textbackslash hspace\{1mm\} \textbackslash textrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ below the pair-instability supernova (PISN) gap, and \${$>$}124 \textbackslash hspace\{1mm\} \textbackslash textrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ above the PISN gap. We further investigate the effects of momentum kicks during black hole formation, calculate cosmological and magnitude limited PISN rates and investigate the effects of high-redshift deviations in the star formation rate. We find that momentum kicks tend to increase delay times of BHBH systems, and our magnitude limited PISN rate estimates indicate that current deep surveys should be able to detect such events. Lastly, we find that our cosmological merger rate estimates change by at most \$\textbackslash sim 8\textbackslash\%\$ for mild deviations of the star formation rate in the early Universe, and by up to \$\textbackslash sim 40\textbackslash\%\$ for extreme deviations.},

  abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than {$\sim$}1 Mpc and mass scales smaller than {$\sim$}10 11 M , the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter\textendash dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than navely predicted in CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satel-lites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues under-lie the most well-documented problems with CDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better under-standing of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density struc-ture hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

The large, high-resolution Bolshoi cosmological simulation of this universe provides a means to statistically sample the dynamical properties of bright satellite galaxies in a large population of dark matter halos. The observed properties of the MCs, including their circular velocity, distance from the center of the MW, and velocity within the MW halo, are used to evaluate the likelihood that a given halo would have each or all of these properties; the posterior probability distribution function (PDF) for any property of the MW system can thus be constructed. This method provides a constraint on the MW virial mass, 1.2 +0.7- 0.4 (stat.)+0.3- 0.3 (sys.) \texttimes{} 1012 M {$\odot$} (68\% confidence), which is consistent with recent determinations that involve very different assumptions. In addition, we calculate the posterior PDF for the density profile of the MW and its satellite accretion history. Although typical satellites of 10 12 M {$\odot$} halos are accreted over a wide range of epochs over the last 10Gyr, we find a {$\sim$}72\% probability that the MCs were accreted within the lastGyr, and a 50\% probability that they were accreted together. \textcopyright{} 2011.

  abstract = {Unveiling the origin of the coalescing binaries detected via gravitational waves (GW) is challenging, notably if no multi-wavelength counterpart is detected. One important quantity for diagnostics is their distribution with respect to the large scale structures of the universe, as encoded, for instance, in their (linear) biases. We discuss the perspectives of inferring these quantities via the cross-correlation of galaxy catalogs with mock GW ones, using both existing and forthcoming galaxy catalogs and using realistic Monte Carlo simulations of GW events. We find that the bias should be marginally detectable for a 10-year data taking of current generation detectors at design sensitivity, at least for binary neutron star mergers. The forthcoming five detector network would allow for a firmer detection of this signal and, in combination with future cosmological surveys, would also permit the detection of the coalescing black hole bias. Such a measurement may also unveil, for instance, a primordial origin of coalescing black holes. To attain this goal, we find that it is crucial to adopt a tomographic approach and to reach a sufficiently accurate localization of GW events. The depth of forthcoming surveys will be fully exploited by third generation GW detectors, which will allow one to perform precision studies of the coalescing black holes bias and attain rather advanced model discrimination capabilities, at a few percent level.},

Using mock data based on a simplified model, we explore the effects of galaxy bias, angular resolution and the matter abundance on these constraints.

  abstract = {Interpreting and modelling astronomical catalogues requires an understanding of the catalogues' completeness or selection function: what properties determine an object's probability of being including in the catalogue? Here we set out to empirically quantify the completeness of the overall catalogue of Gaia's third data release (DR3). This task is not straightforward because Gaia is the all-sky optical survey with the highest angular resolution to date and no consistent ground truth exists to allow direct comparisons. However, well-characterised deeper imaging enables an empirical assessment of Gaia's G-band completeness across parts of the sky. On this basis, we devised a simple analytical completeness model of Gaia as a function of the observed G magnitude and position over the sky, which accounts for both the effects of crowding and the complex Gaia scanning law. Our model only depends on a single quantity: the median magnitude M10 in a patch of the sky of catalogued sources with astrometric\_matched\_transits {$\leq$}10. We note that M10 reflects elementary completeness decisions in the Gaia pipeline and is computable from the Gaia DR3 catalogue itself and therefore applicable across the whole sky. We calibrated our model using the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) and tested its predictions against Hubble Space Telescope observations of globular clusters. We found that our model predicts Gaia's completeness values to a few per cent (RMS) across the sky. We make the model available as a part of the gaiaunlimited Python package built and maintained by the GaiaUnlimited project{$\star$}.},

We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some AGN interlopers including 8 newly discovered narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low mass galaxies (M\textasciitilde 10\^8.5 - 10\^10 M\_sun) with high star formation rates (\textasciitilde 10 M\_sun/yr), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 \textasciitilde{} 8.7) and low reddening (E(B-V) {$<$} 0.25) and they reside in low density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to \textasciitilde 10\^\{-8\} yr\^\{-1\}) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myrs. The few star-forming Peas with HST imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies. They are also similar to high redshift UV-luminous galaxies, e.g., Lyman-break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.},

In our view, science identity accounts both for how women make meaning of science experiences and how society structures possible meanings. Primary data included ethnographic interviews during students' undergraduate careers, follow-up interviews 6 years later, and ongoing member-checking. Our results highlight the importance of recognition by others for women in the three science identity trajectories: research scientist; altruistic scientist; and disrupted scientist. The women with research scientist identities were passionate about science and recognized themselves and were recognized by science faculty as science people. The women with altruistic scientist identities regarded science as a vehicle for altruism and created innovative meanings of ``science,'' ``recognition by others,'' and ``woman of color in science.'' The women with disrupted scientist identities sought, but did not often receive, recognition by meaningful scientific others. Although they were ultimately successful, their trajectories were more difficult because, in part, their bids for recognition were disrupted by the interaction with gendered, ethnic, and racial factors. This study clarifies theoretical conceptions of science identity, promotes a rethinking of recruitment and retention efforts, and illuminates various ways women of color experience, make meaning of, and negotiate the culture of science. \ss{} 2007Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Context. The full third Gaia data release will provide, for the first time, the calibrated spectra obtained with the blue and red Gaia slitless spectrophotometers (BP and RP, respectively). Gaia is a very complex mission and cannot be considered as a single instrument, but rather as many instruments. The two lines of sight with wide fields of view introduce strong variations of the observations across the large focal plane with more than one hundred different detectors. The main challenge when facing Gaia spectral calibration is that no lamp spectra or flat fields are available during the mission. Also, the significant size of the line spread function with respect to the dispersion of the prisms produces alien photons contaminating neighbouring positions of the spectra. This makes the calibration special and different from standard approaches.},

We also fit to the data using the full range of scales \$0.1-60\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\$Mpc modelled by the Aemulus cosmological emulator and find a \$4.5\textbackslash sigma\$ tension in the amplitude of the halo velocity field with the Planck+\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model, driven by a mismatch on the non-linear scales. This may not be cosmological in origin, and could be due to a breakdown in the Halo Occupation Distribution model used in the emulator.

For practical reasons, the spatial resolution at which this can be done is necessarily limited. Consequently, one needs a mapping between the density of dark matter averaged over {$\sim$} Mpc scales, and the distribution of dark matter halos (used as a proxy for galaxies) in the same region. Here we demonstrate a method for determining the halo mass distribution function by learning the tracer bias between density fields and halo catalogues using a neural bias model. The method is based on the Bayesian analysis of simple, physically motivated, neural network-like architectures, which we denote as neural physical engines, and neural density estimation. As a result, we are able to sample the initial phases of the dark matter density field whilst inferring the parameters describing the halo mass distribution function, providing a fully Bayesian interpretation of both the initial dark matter density distribution and the neural bias model. We successfully run an upgraded borg inference using our new likelihood and neural bias model with halo catalogues derived from full N-body simulations. We notice orders of magnitude improvement in modelling compared to classical biasing techniques.},

The aim of this work is to validate the quasar selection by studying the impact of imaging systematics as well as stellar and galactic contaminants, and to develop a procedure to mitigate them. Density fluctuations of quasar targets are found to be related to photometric properties such as seeing and depth of the Data Release 9 of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. To model this complex relation, we explore machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron) as an alternative to the standard linear regression. Splitting the footprint of the Legacy Imaging Surveys into three regions according to photometric properties, we perform an independent analysis in each region, validating our method using eBOSS EZ-mocks. The mitigation procedure is tested by comparing the angular correlation of the corrected target selection on each photometric region to the angular correlation function obtained using quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)Data Release 16. With our procedure, we recover a similar level of correlation between DESI quasar targets and SDSS quasars in two thirds of the total footprint and we show that the excess of correlation in the remaining area is due to a stellar contamination which should be removed with DESI spectroscopic data. We derive the Limber parameters in our three imaging regions and compare them to previous measurements from SDSS and the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey.},

  abstract = {The independent measurement of the Hubble constant with gravitational-wave standard sirens will potentially shed light on the tension between the local distance ladders and Planck experiments. Therefore, thorough understanding of the sources of systematic uncertainty for the standard siren method is crucial. In this Letter, we focus on two scenarios that will potentially dominate the systematic uncertainty of standard sirens. First, simulations of electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star mergers suggest aspherical emissions, so the binaries available for the standard siren method can be selected by their viewing angles. This selection effect can lead to {$\greaterequivlnt$}2\% bias in Hubble constant measurement even with mild selection. Second, if the binary viewing angles are constrained by the electromagnetic counterpart observations but the bias of the constraints is not controlled under {$\sim$}10\textdegree, the resulting systematic uncertainty in the Hubble constant will be {$>$}3\%. In addition, we find that both of the systematics cannot be properly removed by the viewing angle measurement from gravitational-wave observations. Comparing to the known dominant systematic uncertainty for standard sirens, the {$\leq$}2\% gravitational-wave calibration uncertainty, the effects from the viewing angle appear to be more significant. Therefore, the systematic uncertainty from the viewing angle might be a major challenge before the standard sirens can resolve the tension in the Hubble constant, which is currently {$\sim$}9\%.},

In this paper, we advocate performing this task using the scattering transform, a statistical tool sharing ideas with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) but requiring neither training nor tuning. It generates a compact set of coefficients, which can be used as robust summary statistics for non-Gaussian information. It is especially suited for fields presenting localized structures and hierarchical clustering, such as the cosmological density field. To demonstrate its power, we apply this estimator to a cosmological parameter inference problem in the context of weak lensing. On simulated convergence maps with realistic noise, the scattering transform outperforms classic estimators and is on a par with the state-of-the-art CNN. It retains advantages of traditional statistical descriptors, has provable stability properties, allows to check for systematics, and importantly, the scattering coefficients are interpretable. It is a powerful and attractive estimator for observational cosmology and the study of physical fields in general.},

BH spin-up may result from a number of processes, including accretion of matter onto the BH itself, and catastrophic events such as BH-BH mergers. Aims. We study the intriguing properties of the powerful (L bol {$\sim$} 10 47 erg s -1) radio-loud quasar 3C 186. This object shows peculiar features both in the images and in the spectra. Methods. We utilize near-IR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images to study the properties of the host galaxy, and HST UV and Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectra to study the kinematics of the source. Chandra X-ray data are also used to better constrain the physical interpretation. Results. HST imaging shows that the active nucleus is offset by 1.3 {$\pm$} 0.1 arcsec (i.e. {$\sim$}11 kpc) with respect to the center of the host galaxy. Spectroscopic data show that the broad emission lines are offset by -2140 {$\pm$} 390 km s -1 with respect to the narrow lines. Velocity shifts are often seen in QSO spectra, in particular in high-ionization broad emission lines. The host galaxy of the quasar displays a distorted morphology with possible tidal features that are typical of the late stages of a galaxy merger. Conclusions. A number of scenarios can be envisaged to account for the observed features. While the presence of a peculiar outflow cannot be completely ruled out, all of the observed features are consistent with those expected if the QSO is associated with a gravitational wave (GW) recoiling BH. Future detailed studies of this object will allow us to confirm this type of scenario and will enable a better understanding of both the physics of BH-BH mergers and the phenomena associated with the emission of GW from astrophysical sources.},

  abstract = {By absorbing fluctuations into a local background, separate universe simulations provide a powerful technique to characterize the response of small-scale observables to the long-wavelength density fluctuations, for example those of the power spectrum and halo mass function which lead to the squeezed-limit \$n\$-point function and halo bias, respectively. Using quintessence dark energy as the paradigmatic example, we extend these simulation techniques to cases where non-gravitational forces in other sectors establish a Jeans scale across which the growth of density fluctuations becomes scale dependent. By characterizing the separate universes with matching background expansion histories, we show that the power spectrum and mass function responses depend on whether the long-wavelength mode is above or below the Jeans scale. Correspondingly, the squeezed bispectrum and halo bias also become scale dependent. Models of bias that are effectively local in the density field at a single epoch, initial or observed, cannot describe this effect which highlights the importance of temporal nonlocality in structure formation. Validated by these quintessence tests, our techniques are applicable to a wide range of models where the complex dynamics of additional fields affect the clustering of matter in the linear regime and it would otherwise be difficult to simulate their impact in the nonlinear regime.},

Using magnetohydrodynamic simulations from the IllustrisTNG project, we focus on haloes of mass \$10\^\{10\textbackslash!-\textbackslash!14\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\$ from the 50~Mpc (TNG50) and 100~Mpc (TNG100) boxes and compare them to dark matter-only (DMO) analogues and other simulations, e.g. Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO) and Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE). We further quantify the prediction uncertainty by varying the feedback models using smaller 25~\$\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\textbackslash, h\^\{-1\}\$ boxes. We find that (i) galaxy formation results in rounder haloes compared to DMO simulations, in qualitative agreement with past results. Haloes of mass~\$\{\textbackslash approx \}2\textbackslash times 10\^\{12\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\$ are most spherical, with an average minor-to-major axial ratio of \$\textbackslash langle s \textbackslash rangle\$ {$\approx~$}0.75 in the inner halo, an increase of 40~per~cent compared to their DMO counterparts. No significant difference is present for low-mass \$10\^\{10\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\$ haloes; (ii) stronger feedback, e.g. increasing galactic wind speed, reduces the impact of baryons; (iii) the inner halo shape correlates with the stellar mass fraction, explaining the dependence of halo shapes on feedback models; and (iv) the fiducial and weaker feedback models are most consistent with observational estimates of the Milky Way halo shape. At fixed halo mass, very diverse and possibly unrealistic feedback models all predict inner shapes closer to one another than to the DMO results. Because of the large halo-to-halo variation in halo shape, a larger observational sample is required to statistically distinguish different baryonic prescriptions.},

The reference catalogues are drawn from the BigMultiDark N-body simulation. Both friend-of-friends (including distinct halos only) and spherical overdensity (including distinct halos and subhalos) catalogs have been used with the typical number density of a large-volume galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that a proper biasing model is essential for reproducing the power spectrum at quasilinear and even smaller scales. With respect to various clustering statistics a methodology based on perturbation theory and a realistic biasing model leads to very good agreement with N-body simulations. However, for the quadrupole of the correlation function or the power spectrum, only the method based on semi-N-body simulation could reach high accuracy (1\% level) at small scales, i.e., r{$<$}25 Mpc/h or k{$>$}0.15 h/Mpc. Full N-body solutions will remain indispensable to produce reference catalogues. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that the far more efficient approximate solvers can reach a few percent accuracy in terms of clustering statistics at the scales interesting for the large-scale structure analysis after calibration with a few reference N-body calculations. This makes them useful for massive production aimed at covariance studies, to scan large parameter spaces, and to estimate uncertainties in data analysis techniques, such as baryon acoustic oscillation reconstruction, redshift distortion measurements, etc.},

In this report, we continue our previous study [2] of the Decaying Dark Matter (DDM) model adding all available recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) measurements. We find, that the BAO/RSD measurements generically prefer the standard {$\Lambda$}CDM and impose an upper limit on the DDM fraction at the level of {$\sim$} 5 \%, strengthening by a factor of 1.5 limits obtained in [2] mostly from CMB data. However, the numbers vary from one analysis to other based on the same Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 (DR12) galaxy sample, and in particular cases the DDM model provides with even better fit to the cosmological data as compared to the {$\Lambda$}CDM. The improvement can be as large as 1.8 {$\sigma$} and grows to 3.3 {$\sigma$} when the CMB lensing power amplitude AL is introduced as a free fitting parameter.},

Equivariant networks have shown excellent performance and data efficiency on vision and medical imaging problems that exhibit symmetries. Here we show how this principle can be extended beyond global symmetries to local gauge transformations. This enables the development of a very general class of convolutional neural networks on manifolds that depend only on the intrinsic geometry, and which includes many popular methods from equivariant and geometric deep learning. We implement gauge equivariant CNNs for signals defined on the surface of the icosahedron, which provides a reasonable approximation of the sphere. By choosing to work with this very regular manifold, we are able to implement the gauge equivariant convolution using a single conv2d call, making it a highly scalable and practical alternative to Spherical CNNs. Using this method, we demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods on the task of segmenting omnidirectional images and global climate patterns.},

  abstract = {Galaxies are not uniformly distributed in space. On large scales the Universe displays coherent structure, with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on scales of \textasciitilde 1-3 Mpc/h, which lie at the intersections of long filaments of galaxies that are {$>$}10 Mpc/h in length. Vast regions of relatively empty space, known as voids, contain very few galaxies and span the volume in between these structures. This observed large scale structure depends both on cosmological parameters and on the formation and evolution of galaxies. Using the two-point correlation function, one can trace the dependence of large scale structure on galaxy properties such as luminosity, color, stellar mass, and track its evolution with redshift. Comparison of the observed galaxy clustering signatures with dark matter simulations allows one to model and understand the clustering of galaxies and their formation and evolution within their parent dark matter halos. Clustering measurements can determine the parent dark matter halo mass of a given galaxy population, connect observed galaxy populations at different epochs, and constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy evolution models. This chapter describes the methods used to measure the two-point correlation function in both redshift and real space, presents the current results of how the clustering amplitude depends on various galaxy properties, and discusses quantitative measurements of the structures of voids and filaments. The interpretation of these results with current theoretical models is also presented.},

Difficulties with the statistical treatment of density perturbations such as the fact that the LN model is not completely specified by its moments have been revealed by analysis of the model. It is shown that for discriminating between Gaussian and non-Gaussian fluctuations the method of representing the three- and four-point correlation functions of galaxies in terms of the parameters Q and R is not useful.

This is expected to result in a scale-dependent dipolar modulation of the acceleration of the expansion rate inferred from observations of objects within the bulk flow. From a maximum-likelihood analysis of the Joint Light-curve Analysis catalogue of Type Ia supernovae, we find that the deceleration parameter, in addition to a small monopole, indeed has a much bigger dipole component aligned with the cosmic microwave background dipole, which falls exponentially with redshift z: q0 = qm + qd.n' exp(-z/S). The best fit to data yields qd = -8.03 and S = 0.0262 (? d {$\sim$} 100 Mpc), rejecting isotropy (qd = 0) with 3.9{$\sigma$} statistical significance, while qm = -0.157 and consistent with no acceleration (qm = 0) at 1.4{$\sigma$}. Thus the cosmic acceleration deduced from supernovae may be an artefact of our being non-Copernican observers, rather than evidence for a dominant component of "dark energy" in the Universe.},

  abstract = {Article published by EDP Sciences, to be cited as https://doi. ABSTRACT The Gaia Galactic survey mission is designed and optimized to obtain astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy of nearly two billion stars in our Galaxy. Yet as an all-sky multi-epoch survey, Gaia also observes several million extragalactic objects down to a magnitude of G {$\sim$} 21 mag. Due to the nature of the Gaia onboard-selection algorithms, these are mostly point-source-like objects. Using data provided by the satellite, we have identified quasar and galaxy candidates via supervised machine learning methods, and estimate their redshifts using the low resolution BP/RP spectra. We further characterise the surface brightness profiles of host galaxies of quasars and of galaxies from pre-defined input lists. Here we give an overview of the processing of extragalactic objects, describe the data products in Gaia DR3, and analyse their properties. Two integrated tables contain the main results for a high completeness, but low purity (50-70\%), set of 6.6 million candidate quasars and 4.8 million candidate galaxies. We provide queries that select purer sub-samples of these containing 1.9 million probable quasars and 2.9 million probable galaxies (both {$\sim$}95\% purity). We also use high quality BP/RP spectra of 43 thousand high probability quasars over the redshift range 0.05-4.36 to construct a composite quasar spectrum spanning restframe wavelengths from 72-1000 nm.},

  abstract = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250 000 galaxies. This paper describes the survey design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements and the survey data base. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2\textdegree{} diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ = 19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 8O\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 15\textdegree{} around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 10\textdegree{} along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000 deg2 and has a median depth of {\=z} = 0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000 \AA{} at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0 \AA{} and a median S/N of 13 pixel-1. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5; Q {$\geq$} 3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km s-1. The overall redshift completeness for Q {$\geq$} 3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit. The 2dFGRS data base is available on the World Wide Web at http://www. mso.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS.},

We use a simple, nonparametric model, which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities to the maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos (Vmax) by preserving the observed galaxy luminosity function in order to match the halos in simulations with observed galaxies. The novel feature of the model is the use of the maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, Vmacacx, for subhalos, the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. We argue that for subhalos in dissipationless simulations, Vmacacx reflects the luminosity and stellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity at the epoch of observation, Vmnoawx . The simulations and our model L-Vmax relation predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of the two-point correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxy clustering in the SDSS data at z \$ 0 and in the DEEP2 samples at z \$ 1 over the entire probed range of projected separations, 0:1 {$<$} rp/(h\`A1 Mpc) {$<$} 10:0. In particular, the small-scale upturn of the correlation function from the power-law form in the SDSS and DEEP2 luminosity-selected samples is reproduced very well. At z \$ 3 5, our predictions also match the observed shape and amplitude of the angular two-point correlation function of Lyman break galaxies ( LBGs) on both large and small scales, including the small-scale upturn. This suggests that, like galaxies in lower redshift samples, the LBGs are fair tracers of the overall halo population and that their luminosity is tightly correlated with the circular velocity (and hence mass) of their dark matter halos.},

  abstract = {One of the main predictions of excursion set theory is that the clustering of dark matter haloes only depends on halo mass. However, it has been long established that the clustering of haloes also depends on other properties, including formation time, concentration, and spin; this effect is commonly known as halo assembly bias. We use a suite of gravity-only simulations to study the dependence of halo assembly bias on cosmology; these simulations cover cosmological parameters spanning 10\$\textbackslash sigma\$ around state-of-the-art best-fitting values, including standard extensions of the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM paradigm such as neutrino mass and dynamical dark energy. We find that the strength of halo assembly bias presents variations smaller than 0.05 dex across all cosmologies studied for concentration and spin selected haloes, letting us conclude that the dependence of halo assembly bias upon cosmology is negligible. We then study the dependence of galaxy assembly bias (i.e. the manifestation of halo assembly bias in galaxy clustering) on cosmology using subhalo abundance matching. We find that galaxy assembly bias also presents very small dependence upon cosmology (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 2\$\textbackslash\%\$-4\$\textbackslash\%\$ of the total clustering); on the other hand, we find that the dependence of this signal on the galaxy formation parameters of our galaxy model is much stronger. Taken together, these results let us conclude that the dependence of halo and galaxy assembly bias on cosmology is practically negligible.},

We first describe the model, and demon- strate its accuracy by comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophys- ical applications of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution of galaxies, the nonlinear velocity, momentum and pressure fields, descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.},

  abstract = {We present a semi-analytic, physically motivated model for dark matter halo concentration as a function of halo mass and redshift. The semi-analytic model combines an analytic model for the halo mass accretion history (MAH), based on extended Press Schechter (EPS) theory, with an empirical relation between concentration and formation time obtained through fits to the results of numerical simulations. Because the semi-analytic model is based on EPS theory, it can be applied to wide ranges in mass, redshift and cosmology. The resulting concentration-mass (c-M) relations are found to agree with the simulations, and because the model applies only to relaxed halos, they do not exhibit the upturn at high masses or high redshifts found by some recent works. We predict a change of slope in the z=0 c-M relation at a mass scale of \$10\^\{11\}\textbackslash rm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. We find that this is due to the change in the functional form of the halo MAH, which goes from being dominated by an exponential (for high-mass halos) to a power-law (for low-mass halos). During the latter phase, the core radius remains approximately constant, and the concentration grows due to the drop of the background density. We also analyse how the c-M relation predicted by this work affects the power produced by dark matter annihilation, finding that at z = 0 the power is two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained from extrapolating best-fitting c-M relations. We provide fits to the c-M relations as well as numerical routines to compute concentrations and MAHs.},

  abstract = {The clustering of dark haloes depends not only on their mass but also on their assembly history, a dependence we term 'assembly bias'. Using a galaxy formation model grafted on to the Millennium Simulation of the ACDM cosmogony, we study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original simulation to 'shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations between assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark matter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances two-point correlations by 10 per cent for galaxies with MbJ - 5 log h brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar amount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour, assembly bias is 5 per cent stronger for red galaxies and 5 per cent weaker for blue ones. Halo central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central galaxies. Shuffling galaxies among haloes of fixed formation redshift or concentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much smaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys. \textcopyright{} 2006 RAS.},

  abstract = {We present SHEEP, a new machine learning approach to the classic problem of astronomical source classification, which combines the outputs from the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost learning algorithms to create stronger classifiers. A novel step in our pipeline is that prior to performing the classification, SHEEP first estimates photometric redshifts, which are then placed into the data set as an additional feature for classification model training; this results in significant improvements in the subsequent classification performance. SHEEP contains two distinct classification methodologies: (i) Multi-class and (ii) one versus all with correction by a meta-learner. We demonstrate the performance of SHEEP for the classification of stars, galaxies, and quasars using a data set composed of SDSS and WISE photometry of 3.5 million astronomical sources. The resulting \emph{F{$<$}i/{$>$}1 -scores are as follows: 0.992 for galaxies; 0.967 for quasars; and 0.985 for stars. In terms of the \emph{F{$<$}i/{$>$}1-scores for the three classes, SHEEP is found to outperform a recent RandomForest-based classification approach using an essentially identical data set. Our methodology also facilitates model and data set explainability via feature importances; it also allows the selection of sources whose uncertain classifications may make them interesting sources for follow-up observations.}}},

The ongoing and future large and complex multi-messenger sky surveys impose a wide exploiting of robust and efficient automated methods to classify the observed structures and to detect and characterize peculiar and unexpected sources. We performed a preliminary experiment on KiDS DR4 data, by applying to the problem of anomaly detection two different unsupervised machine learning algorithms, considered as potentially promising methods to detect peculiar sources, a Disentangled Convolutional Autoencoder and an Unsupervised Random Forest. The former method, working directly on images, is considered potentially able to identify peculiar objects like interacting galaxies and gravitational lenses. The latter instead, working on catalogue data, could identify objects with unusual values of magnitudes and colours, which in turn could indicate the presence of singularities.},

  abstract = {The goal of generative models is to learn the intricate relations between the data to create new simulated data, but current approaches fail in very high dimensions. When the true data generating process is based on physical processes these impose symmetries and constraints, and the generative model can be created by learning an effective description of the underlying physics, which enables scaling of the generative model to very high dimensions. In this work we propose Lagrangian Deep Learning (LDL) for this purpose, applying it to learn outputs of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The model uses layers of Lagrangian displacements of particles describing the observables to learn the effective physical laws. The displacements are modeled as the gradient of an effective potential, which explicitly satisfies the translational and rotational invariance. The total number of learned parameters is only of order 10, and they can be viewed as effective theory parameters. We combine N-body solver FastPM with LDL and apply them to a wide range of cosmological outputs, from the dark matter to the stellar maps, gas density and temperature. The computational cost of LDL is nearly four orders of magnitude lower than the full hydrodynamical simulations, yet it outperforms it at the same resolution. We achieve this with only of order 10 layers from the initial conditions to the final output, in contrast to typical cosmological simulations with thousands of time steps. This opens up the possibility of analyzing cosmological observations entirely within this framework, without the need for large dark-matter simulations.},

  abstract = {Our universe is homogeneous and isotropic, and its perturbations obey translation and rotation symmetry. In this work we develop Translation and Rotation Equivariant Normalizing Flow (TRENF), a generative Normalizing Flow (NF) model which explicitly incorporates these symmetries, defining the data likelihood via a sequence of Fourier space-based convolutions and pixel-wise nonlinear transforms. TRENF gives direct access to the high dimensional data likelihood p(x|y) as a function of the labels y, such as cosmological parameters. In contrast to traditional analyses based on summary statistics, the NF approach has no loss of information since it preserves the full dimensionality of the data. On Gaussian random fields, the TRENF likelihood agrees well with the analytical expression and saturates the Fisher information content in the labels y. On nonlinear cosmological overdensity fields from N-body simulations, TRENF leads to significant improvements in constraining power over the standard power spectrum summary statistic. TRENF is also a generative model of the data, and we show that TRENF samples agree well with the N-body simulations it trained on, and that the inverse mapping of the data agrees well with a Gaussian white noise both visually and on various summary statistics: when this is perfectly achieved the resulting p(x|y) likelihood analysis becomes optimal. Finally, we develop a generalization of this model that can handle effects that break the symmetry of the data, such as the survey mask, which enables likelihood analysis on data without periodic boundaries.},

We find pronounced effects of nongaussianity on the clustering of dark matter halos, leading to strongly scale-dependent bias. This suggests that the large-scale clustering of rare objects may provide a sensitive probe of primordial nongaussianity.

  abstract = {The Cosmological Principle, that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, underpins the standard model of cosmology. However, a recent analysis of 1.36 million infrared-selected quasars has identified a significant tension in the amplitude of the number-count dipole compared to that derived from the CMB, thus challenging the Cosmological Principle. Here we present a Bayesian analysis of the same quasar sample, testing various hypotheses using the Bayesian evidence. We find unambiguous evidence for the presence of a dipole in the distribution of quasars with a direction that is consistent with the dipole identified in the CMB. However, the amplitude of the dipole is found to be 2.7 times larger than that expected from the conventional kinematic explanation of the CMB dipole, with a statistical significance of \$5.7\textbackslash sigma\$. To compare these results with theoretical expectations, we sharpen the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM predictions for the probability distribution of the amplitude, taking into account a number of observational and theoretical systematics. In particular, we show that the presence of the galactic plane mask causes a considerable loss of dipole signal due to a leakage of power into higher multipoles, exacerbating the discrepancy in the amplitude. By contrast, we estimate using probabilistic arguments that the source evolution of quasars improves the discrepancy, but only mildly so. These results support the original findings of an anomalously large quasar dipole, independent of the statistical methodology used.},

In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the IGM from z= 2 [-\&gt;] 0 in (48 h-1 Mpc)3, 110-million particle cosmological hydrodynamic simulations using three prescriptions for galactic outflows. We focus on the evolution of IGM physical properties, and how such properties are traced by Ly absorption as detectable using Hubble's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). Our results broadly confirm the canonical picture that most Ly absorbers arise from highly ionized gas tracing filamentary large-scale structure. Growth of structure causes gas to move from the diffuse photoionized IGM into other cosmic phases, namely stars, cold and hot gas within galaxy haloes, and the unbound and shock-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). By today, baryons are comparably divided between bound phases (35 per cent in our favoured outflow model), the diffuse IGM (41 per cent) and the WHIM (24 per cent). Here we (re)define the WHIM as gas with overdensities lower than that in haloes ([IMG]/medium/mnras0408-2051-mu1.gif" ALT="Formula "{$>$} today) and temperatures T {$>$} 105 K, to more closely align it with the missing baryons' that are not easily detectable in emission or Ly absorption. Strong galactic outflows can have a noticeable impact on the temperature of the IGM, though with our favoured momentum-driven wind scalings they do not. When we (mildly) tune our assumed photoionizing background to match the observed evolution of the Ly mean flux decrement, we obtain line count evolution statistics that broadly agree with available (pre-COS) observations. We predict a column density distribution slope of [IMG]/medium/mnras0408-2051-mu2.gif" ALT="Formula "{$>$} for our favoured wind model, in agreement with recent observational estimates, and it becomes shallower with redshift. Winds have a mostly minimal impact, but they do result in a shallower column density slope and more strong lines. With improved statistics, the frequency of strong lines can be a valuable diagnostic of outflows, and the momentum-driven wind model matches existing data significantly better than the two alternatives we consider. The relationship between column density and physical density broadens mildly from z= 2 [-\&gt;] 0, and evolves as [IMG]/medium/mnras0408-2051-mu3.gif" ALT="Formula "{$>$} for diffuse absorbers, consistent with previous studies. Linewidth distributions are quite sensitive to spectral resolution; COS should yield significantly broader lines than higher resolution data. Thermal contributions to linewidths are typically subdominant, so linewidths only loosely reflect the temperature of the absorbing gas. This will hamper attempts to quantify the WHIM using broad Ly absorbers, though it may still be possible to do so statistically. Together, COS data and simulations such as these will provide key insights into the physical conditions of the dominant reservoir of baryons over the majority of cosmic time.},

  abstract = {We present predictions for galactic halo baryon fractions from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with a well-constrained model for galac-tic outflows. Without outflows, halos contain roughly the cosmic fraction of baryons, slightly lowered at high masses owing to pressure support from hot gas. The star formation efficiency is large and increases monotonically to low masses, in disagreement with data. With outflows, the baryon fraction is in-creasingly suppressed in halos to lower masses. A Milky Way-sized halo at z = 0 has about 60\% of the cosmic fraction of baryons, so " missing " halo baryons have largely been evacuated, rather than existing in some hidden form. Large halos ({$\sim$} {$>$} 10 13 M {$\odot$}) contain 85\% of their cosmic share of baryons, which explains the mild missing baryon problem seen in clusters. By comparing results at z = 3 and z = 0, we show that most of the baryon removal occurs at early epochs in larger halos, while smaller halos lose baryons more recently. Star formation efficiency is maximized in halos of {$\sim$} 10 13 M {$\odot$} , dropping significantly to lower masses, which helps reconcile the sub-L * slope of the observed stellar and halo mass functions. These trends are predominantly driven by differential wind recycling, namely, that wind material takes longer to return to low-mass galaxies than high-mass galaxies. The hot gas content of halos is mostly unaffected by outflows, showing that outflows tend to blow holes and escape rather than deposit their energy into halo gas.},

We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z\textasciitilde 2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z{$<$}1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites.

We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z {$\sim$} 2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z 1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z = 0, while not being so strong as to over-quench satellites; Mufasa's current scheme fails at the latter.},

  abstract = {The results of numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering in universes dominated by weakly interacting, 'cold' dark matter are presented. The numerical methods used and the way in which initial conditions were generated are described, and the simulations performed are catalogued. The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

  abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large-scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i = 19.9 over 10,000deg2 to measure BAO to redshifts z {$<$} 0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Ly{$\alpha$} forest in more than 150,000quasar spectra (g {$<$} 22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Ly{$\alpha$} forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA to an accuracy of 1.0\% at redshifts z = 0.3 and z = 0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8\% and 1.7\% at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Ly{$\alpha$} forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate DA (z) and H -1(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9\% at z {$\sim$} 2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS. \textcopyright{} 2013.

  abstract = {Elucidating the connection between the properties of galaxies and the properties of their hosting haloes is a key element in theories of galaxy formation. When the spatial distribution of objects is also taken under consideration, investigating the halo-galaxy connection becomes very relevant for cosmological measurements. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze these intricate relations in the IllustrisTNG300 magnetohydrodynamical simulation. We employ four different algorithms: extremely randomized trees (ERT), K-nearest neighbors (kNN), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and neural networks (NN), along with a stacked model where we combine results from all four approaches. Overall, the different ML algorithms produce consistent results in terms of predicting galaxy properties from a set of input halo properties that include halo mass, concentration, spin, and halo overdensity. For stellar mass, the (predicted v. true) Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.98, dropping down to 0.7-0.8 for specific star formation rate (sSFR), colour, and size. In addition, we test an existing data augmentation technique, designed to alleviate the problem of unbalanced datasets, and show that it improves slightly the shape of the predicted distributions. We also demonstrate that our predictions are good enough to reproduce the power spectra of multiple galaxy populations, defined in terms of stellar mass, sSFR, colour, and size with high accuracy. Our results align with previous reports suggesting that certain galaxy properties cannot be reproduced using halo features alone.},

  abstract = {Aims. We address the origin of the golden mass and time for galaxy formation and the onset of rapid black-hole growth. The preferred dark-halo mass of {$\sim$} 10 12 M {$\odot$} is translated to a characteristic epoch, z {$\sim$} 2, at which the typical forming halos have a comparable mass. Methods. We put together a coherent picture based on existing and new simple analytic modeling and cosmological simulations. Results. We describe how the golden mass arises from two physical mechanisms that suppress gas supply and star formation below and above the golden mass, supernova feedback and virial shock heating of the circum-galactic medium (CGM), respectively. Cosmological simulations reveal that these mechanisms are responsible for a similar favored mass for the dramatic events of gaseous compaction into compact star-forming "blue nuggets", caused by mergers, counter-rotating streams or other mechanisms. This triggers inside-out quenching of star formation, to be maintained by the hot CGM, leading to today's passive early-type galaxies. The blue-nugget phase is responsible for transitions in the galaxy structural, kinematic and compositional properties, e.g., from dark-matter to baryon central dominance and from prolate to oblate shape. The growth of the central black hole is suppressed by supernova feedback below the critical mass, and is free to grow once the halo is massive enough to lock the supernova ejecta by its deep potential well and the hot CGM. A compaction near the golden mass makes the black hole sink to the galactic center and triggers a rapid black-hole growth. This ignites feedback by the Active Galactic Nucleus that helps keeping the CGM hot and maintaining long-term quenching.},

These methods principally rely on two already published algorithms that are the weighted principal component analysis and the weighted phase correlation. The presented approach benefits from a fast implementation; an intuitive interpretation as well as strong diagnostic tools on the potential errors that may arise during predictions. The production of a semi-empirical library of spectra as they will be observed by Gaia is also covered and subsequently used for validation purpose. We detail the pre-processing that is necessary in order for these spectra to be fully exploitable by our algorithms along with the procedures that are used in order to predict the redshifts of the quasars; their continuum slopes; the total equivalent width of their emission lines and whether these are broad absorption line (BAL) quasars or not. Performances of these procedures were assessed in comparison with the Extremely Randomized Trees learning method and were proven to provide better results on the redshift predictions and on the ratio of correctly classified observations though the probability of detection of BAL quasars remains restricted by the low resolution of these spectra as well as by their limited signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the triggering of some warning flags allows us to obtain an extremely pure subset of redshift predictions where approximately 99\% of the observations come along with absolute errors that are below 0.1.},

  abstract = {Context. As part of the third Gaia data release, we present the contributions of the non-stellar and classification modules from the eighth coordination unit (CU8) of the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium, which is responsible for the determination of source astrophysical parameters using Gaia data. This is the third in a series of three papers describing the work done within CU8 for this release. Aims. For each of the five relevant modules from CU8, we summarise their objectives, the methods they employ, their performance, and the results they produce for Gaia DR3. We further advise how to use these data products and highlight some limitations. Methods. The Discrete Source Classifier (DSC) module provides classification probabilities associated with five types of sources: quasars, galaxies, stars, white dwarfs, and physical binary stars. A subset of these sources are processed by the Outlier Analysis (OA) module, which performs an unsupervised clustering analysis, and then associates labels with the clusters to complement the DSC classification. The Quasi Stellar Object Classifier (QSOC) and the Unresolved Galaxy Classifier (UGC) determine the redshifts of the sources classified as quasar and galaxy by the DSC module. Finally, the Total Galactic Extinction (TGE) module uses the extinctions of individual stars determined by another CU8 module to determine the asymptotic extinction along all lines of sight for Galactic latitudes |b| {$>$} 5 deg. Results. Gaia DR3 includes 1591 million sources with DSC classifications; 56 million sources to which the OA clustering is applied; 1.4 million sources with redshift estimates from UGC; 6.4 million sources with QSOC redshift; and 3.1 million level 9 HEALPixes of size 0.013 squared degree, where the extinction is evaluated by TGE.},

  abstract = {To extract information from the clustering of galaxies on non-linear scales, we need to model the connection between galaxies and halos accurately and in a flexible manner. Standard halo occupation distribution (HOD) models make the assumption that the galaxy occupation in a halo is a function of only its mass, however, in reality, the occupation can depend on various other parameters including halo concentration, assembly history, environment, spin, etc. Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation as our target, we show that machine learning tools can be used to capture this high-dimensional dependence and provide more accurate galaxy occupation models. Specifically, we use a random forest regressor to identify which secondary halo parameters best model the galaxy-halo connection and symbolic regression to augment the standard HOD model with simple equations capturing the dependence on those parameters, namely the local environmental overdensity and shear, at the location of a halo. This not only provides insights into the galaxy-formation relationship but, more importantly, improves the clustering statistics of the modeled galaxies significantly. Our approach demonstrates that machine learning tools can help us better understand and model the galaxy-halo connection, and are therefore useful for galaxy formation and cosmology studies from upcoming galaxy surveys.},

The ELG sample contains 173 736 galaxies covering 1170 deg2 in the redshift range 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.1. We perform a BAO measurement from the post-reconstruction power spectrum monopole, and study redshift space distortions (RSD) in the first three even multipoles. Photometric variations yield fluctuations of both the angular and radial survey selection functions. Those are directly inferred from data, imposing integral constraints which we model consistently. The full data set has only a weak preference for a BAO feature (1.4{$\sigma$}).

An estimator of the two-point correlation function is constructed by contrasting the observed distribution of galaxies with that of a uniformly populated random catalog. Using the assumption that the distribution of random galaxies in redshift is independent of angular position allows us to replace pairwise combinatorics with fast integration over probability maps. The new method significantly reduces the computation time while simultaneously increasing the precision of the calculation. It also allows to introduce cosmological parameters only at the last and least computationally expensive stage, which is helpful when exploring various choices for these parameters.},

They aim to compare simulations of this structure formation process with observations of large-scale structure traced by galaxies and infer the properties of the dark energy and dark matter that make up 95\% of the universe. These ensembles of simulations of billions of galaxies are computationally demanding, so that more efficient approaches to tracing the non-linear growth of structure are needed. We build a V-Net based model that transforms fast linear predictions into fully nonlinear predictions from numerical simulations. Our NN model learns to emulate the simulations down to small scales and is both faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art approximate methods. It also achieves comparable accuracy when tested on universes of significantly different cosmological parameters from the one used in training. This suggests that our model generalizes well beyond our training set.},

For modern perturbation theory codes, evaluation time for a single cosmology and redshift can take on the order of two seconds. In combination with the comparable time required to compute linear predictions using a Boltzmann solver, these calculations are the bottleneck for many contemporary large-scale structure analyses. In this work, we construct neural network-based surrogate models for Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) predictions of matter power spectra, real and redshift space galaxy power spectra, and galaxy--matter cross power spectra that attain \$\textbackslash sim 0.1\textbackslash\%\$ (at one sigma) accuracy over a broad range of scales in a \$w\$CDM parameter space. The neural network surrogates can be evaluated in approximately one millisecond, a factor of 1000 times faster than the full Boltzmann code and LPT computations. In a simulated full-shape redshift space galaxy power spectrum analysis, we demonstrate that the posteriors obtained using our surrogates are accurate compared to those obtained using the full LPT model. We make our surrogate models public at https://github.com/sfschen/EmulateLSS, so that others may take advantage of the speed gains they provide to enable rapid iteration on analysis settings, something that is essential in complex contemporary large-scale structure analyses.},

  abstract = {The rapidly growing statistical precision of galaxy surveys has lead to a need for ever-more precise predictions of the observables used to constrain cosmological and galaxy formation models. The primary avenue through which such predictions will be obtained is suites of numerical simulations. These simulations must span the relevant model parameter spaces, be large enough to obtain the precision demanded by upcoming data, and be thoroughly validated in order to ensure accuracy. In this paper we present one such suite of simulations, forming the basis for the AEMULUS Project, a collaboration devoted to precision emulation of galaxy survey observables. We have run a set of 75 (1.05 h -1 Gpc) 3 simulations with mass resolution and force softening of 3.51 \texttimes{} 10 10 {$\Omega$}m 0.3 h -1 M and 20 h -1 kpc respectively in 47 different wCDM cosmologies spanning the range of parameter space allowed by the combination of recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae results. We present convergence tests of several observables including spherical overdensity halo mass functions, galaxy projected correlation functions, galaxy clustering in redshift space, and matter and halo correlation functions and power spectra. We show that these statistics are converged to 1\% (2\%) for halos with more than 500 (200) particles respectively and scales of r {$>$} 200 h -1 kpc in real space or k {$\sim$} 3 h Mpc -1 in harmonic space for z {$\leq$} 1. We find that the dominant source of uncertainty comes from varying the particle loading of the simulations. This leads to large systematic errors for statistics using halos with fewer than 200 particles and scales smaller than k {$\sim$} 4 h Mpc -1. We provide the halo catalogs and snapshots detailed in this work to the community at https://AemulusProject.github.io.},

The survey data will allow us to measure the dark energy and dark matter densities and the dark energy equation of state through four independent methods: galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing tomography, galaxy angular clustering, and supernova distances. These methods are doubly complementary: they constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision of dark energy measurements.},

  abstract = {This review presents a comprehensive overview of galaxy bias, that is, the statistical relation between the distribution of galaxies and matter. We focus on large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales, the clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion, and the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of coefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a detailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the rigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions of General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key components of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational observables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their time derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all these contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the peak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical meaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection between bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We then review the excursion-set formalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias parameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of galaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics that go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions: primordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the description of galaxy bias in the galaxies' rest frame is related to clustering statistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual galaxy catalogs.},

  abstract = {Recent work has found evidence for a difference in the bias and dark matter halo masses of WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer)-selected obscured and unobscured quasars, implying a distinction between these populations beyond random line-of-sight effects. However, the significance of this difference in the most up-to-date measurements is relatively weak, at {$\sim$}2{$\sigma$} for individual measurements, but bolstered by agreement from different techniques, including angular clustering and cross-correlations with cosmic microwave background lensing maps. Here, we expand the footprint of previous work, aiming to improve the precision of both methods. In this larger area, we correct for position-dependent selection effects, in particular fluctuations of the WISE-selected quasar density as a function of Galactic latitude. We also measure the cross-correlation of the obscured and unobscured samples and confirm that they are well matched in redshift, both centred at z = 1. Combined with very similar detection fractions and magnitude distributions in the long-wavelength WISE bands, this redshift match strongly supports the fact that infrared selection identifies obscured and unobscured quasars of similar bolometric luminosity. Finally, we perform cross-correlations with confirmed spectroscopic quasars, again confirming the results from other methods \textendash{} obscured quasars reside in haloes a factor of 3 times more massive than unobscured quasars. This difference is significant at the {$\sim$}5{$\sigma$} level when the measurements are combined, providing strong support for the idea that obscuration in at least some quasars is tied to the larger environment, and may have an evolutionary component.},

The most straightforward way to carry out such tests is to compute the likelihood function L, the probability of getting the data given the theory. We write down this function for a general galaxy survey. The full likelihood function is very complex, depending on all of the \$n\$-point functions of the theory under consideration. Even in the simplest case, where only the two point function is non-vanishing (Gaussian perturbations), L cannot be calculated exactly, primarily because of the Poisson nature of the galaxy distribution. Here we expand L about the (trivial) zero correlation limit. As a first application, we take the binned values of the two point function as free parameters and show that L peaks at \$(DD - DR + RR)/DD\$. Using Monte Carlo techniques, we compare this estimator with the traditional \$DD/DR\$ and Landy \& Szalay estimators. More generally, the success of this expansion should pave the way for further applications of the likelihood function.},

  abstract = {We select galaxies from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations (\$M\_*{$>$}10\^9\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$ at \$0\textbackslash le z\textbackslash le2\$) and characterize the shapes and evolutions of their UVJ and star-formation rate -- stellar mass (SFR-\$M\_*\$) diagrams. We quantify the systematic uncertainties related to different criteria to classify star-forming vs. quiescent galaxies, different SFR estimates, and by accounting for the star formation measured within different physical apertures. The TNG model returns the observed features of the UVJ diagram at \$z\textbackslash leq2\$, with a clear separation between two classes of galaxies. It also returns a tight star-forming main sequence (MS) for \$M\_*{$<$}10\^\{10.5\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$ with a \$\textbackslash sim0.3\$ dex scatter at \$z\textbackslash sim0\$ in our fiducial choices. If a UVJ-based cut is adopted, the TNG MS exhibits a downwardly bending at stellar masses of about \$10\^\{10.5-10.7\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$. Moreover, the model predicts that \$\textbackslash sim80\textbackslash,(50)\$ per cent of \$10\^\{10.5-11\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$ galaxies at \$z=0\textasciitilde (z=2)\$ are quiescent and the numbers of quenched galaxies at intermediate redshifts and high masses are in better agreement with observational estimates than previous models. However, shorter SFR-averaging timescales imply higher normalizations and scatter of the MS, while smaller apertures lead to underestimating the galaxy SFRs: overall we estimate the inspected systematic uncertainties to sum up to about \$0.2-0.3\$ dex in the locus of the MS and to about 15 percentage points in the quenched fractions. While TNG color distributions are clearly bimodal, this is not the case for the SFR logarithmic distributions in bins of stellar mass (SFR\$\textbackslash geq 10\^\{-3\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$yr\$\^\{-1\}\$). Finally, the slope and \$z=0\$ normalization of the TNG MS are consistent with observational findings; however, the locus of the TNG MS remains lower by about \$0.2-0.5\$ dex at \$0.75\textbackslash le z{$<$}2\$ than the available observational estimates taken at face value.},

  abstract = {Since July 2014, the Gaia space mission has been continuously scanning the sky and observing the extragalactic Universe with unprecedented spatial resolution in the optical domain (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 180 mas by the end of the mission). Gaia provides an opportunity to study the morphology of the galaxies of the local Universe (z{$<$}0.45) with much higher resolution than has ever been attained from the ground. It also allows us to provide the first morphological all-sky space catalogue of nearby galaxies and galaxies that host quasars in the visible spectrum. We present the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium CU4-Surface Brightness Profile fitting pipeline, which aims to recover the light profile of nearby galaxies and galaxies hosting quasars. The pipeline uses a direct model based on the Radon transform to measure the two-dimensional surface brightness profile of the extended sources. It simulates a large set of 2D light profiles and iteratively looks for the one that best reproduces the 1D observations by means of a Bayesian exploration of the parameters space. We also present our method for setting up the input lists of galaxies and quasars to be processed. We successfully analysed 1\textbackslash,103\textbackslash,691 known quasars and detected a host galaxy around 64\textbackslash,498 of them (\$\textbackslash sim\$6\textbackslash\%). We publish the surface brightness profiles of the host for a subset of 15\textbackslash,867 quasars with robust solutions. The distribution of the S\textbackslash 'ersic index describing the light profile of the host galaxies peaks at \$\textbackslash sim\$ 0.8 with a mean value of \$\textbackslash sim\$ 1.9, indicating that these galaxies hosting a quasar are consistent with disc-like galaxies. The pipeline also analysed 940\textbackslash,887 galaxies with both a \textbackslash sersic and a de Vaucouleurs profile and derived robust solutions for 914\textbackslash,837 of them. The distribution of the S\textbackslash 'ersic indices confirms that \textbackslash gaia mostly detects elliptical galaxies and that very few discs are measured.},

We measured the two-point real-space correlation function wp(rp) for four volume-limited subsamples selected by stellar mass and four volume-limited subsamples selected by MUV absolute magnitude. We find that the scale-dependent clustering amplitude r0 significantly increases with increasing luminosity and stellar mass. For the least luminous galaxies (MUV {$<$} -19.0), we measured a correlation length r0 = 2.87 {$\pm$} 0.22 h-1 Mpc and slope {$\gamma$} = 1.59 {$\pm$} 0.07, while for the most luminous (MUV {$<$} -20.2) r0 = 5.35 {$\pm$} 0.50 h-1 Mpc and {$\gamma$} = 1.92 {$\pm$} 0.25. These measurements correspond to a strong relative bias between these two subsamples of {$\Delta$}b/b{${_\ast}$} = 0.43. Fitting a five-parameter halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, we find that the most luminous (MUV {$<$} -20.2) and massive (M{${_\ast}$} {$>$} 1010 h-1 M{$\odot$}) galaxies occupy the most massive dark matter haloes with {$\langle$}Mh{$\rangle$} = 1012.30 h-1 M{$\odot$}. Similar to the trends observed at lower redshift, the minimum halo mass Mmin depends on the luminosity and stellar mass of galaxies and grows from Mmin = 109.73 h-1 M{$\odot$} to Mmin = 1011.58 h-1 M{$\odot$} from the faintest to the brightest among our galaxy sample, respectively. We find the difference between these halo masses to be much more pronounced than is observed for local galaxies of similar properties. Moreover, at z \textasciitilde{} 3, we observe that the masses at which a halo hosts, on average, one satellite and one central galaxy is M1 {$\approx$} 4Mmin over all luminosity ranges, which is significantly lower than observed at z \textasciitilde{} 0; this indicates that the halo satellite occupation increases with redshift. The luminosity and stellar mass dependence is also reflected in the measurements of the large-scale galaxy bias, which we model as bg,HOD ({$>$}L) = 1.92 + 25.36(L/L{${_\ast}$})7.01. We conclude our study with measurements of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR). We observe a significant model-observation discrepancy for low-mass galaxies, suggesting a higher than expected star formation efficiency of these galaxies.},

We use the concept of non-linear and stochastic galaxy biasing in the framework of halo occupation statistics to constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics and to unveil the origin of galaxy biasing. The bias function \$\textbackslash Gamma\_\{\textbackslash text\{gm\}\}(r\_\{\textbackslash text\{p\}\})\$, where \$r\_\{\textbackslash text\{p\}\}\$ is the projected comoving separation, is evaluated using the analytical halo model from which the scale dependence of \$\textbackslash Gamma\_\{\textbackslash text\{gm\}\}(r\_\{\textbackslash text\{p\}\})\$, and the origin of the non-linearity and stochasticity in halo occupation models can be inferred. Our observations unveil the physical reason for the non-linearity and stochasticity, further explored using hydrodynamical simulations, with the stochasticity mostly originating from the non-Poissonian behaviour of satellite galaxies in the dark matter haloes and their spatial distribution, which does not follow the spatial distribution of dark matter in the halo. The observed non-linearity is mostly due to the presence of the central galaxies, as was noted from previous theoretical work on the same topic. We also see that overall, more massive galaxies reveal a stronger scale dependence, and out to a larger radius. Our results show that a wealth of information about galaxy bias is hidden in halo occupation models. These models should therefore be used to determine the influence of galaxy bias in cosmological studies.},

Using a fully-crossed, between-subjects experimental design, biology and physics professors (n = 251) from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical curriculum vitae (CVs) depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate's name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more hirable than Black candidates. An interaction between candidate gender and race emerged for those in physics, whereby Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others. Women were rated more likeable than men candidates across departments. Our results highlight how understanding the underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in STEM requires examining both racial and gender biases as well as how they intersect.},

These experiments, composed of data from SDSS, SDSS-II, BOSS, and eBOSS, offer independent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements of angular-diameter distances and Hubble distances relative to the sound horizon, \$r\_d\$, from eight different samples and six measurements of the growth rate parameter, \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, from redshift-space distortions (RSD). This composite sample is the most constraining of its kind and allows us to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cosmological model after two decades of dedicated spectroscopic observation. We show that the BAO data alone are able to rule out dark-energy-free models at more than eight standard deviations in an extension to the flat, \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model that allows for curvature. When combined with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements of temperature and polarization the BAO data provide nearly an order of magnitude improvement on curvature constraints. The RSD measurements indicate a growth rate that is consistent with predictions from Planck primary data and with General Relativity. When combining the results of SDSS BAO and RSD with external data, all multiple-parameter extensions remain consistent with a \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Regardless of cosmological model, the precision on \$\textbackslash Omega\_\textbackslash Lambda\$, \$H\_0\$, and \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, remains at roughly 1\textbackslash\%, showing changes of less than 0.6\textbackslash\% in the central values between models.

  abstract = {We discuss the effects of non-linear structure formation on the signature of acoustic oscillations in the late-time galaxy distribution. We argue that the dominant non-linear effect is the differential motion of pairs of tracers separated by 150 Mpc. These motions are driven by bulk flows and cluster formation and are much smaller than the acoustic scale itself. We present a model for the non-linear evolution based on the distribution of pairwise Lagrangian displacements that provides a quantitative model for the degradation of the acoustic signature, even for biased tracers in redshift space. The Lagrangian displacement distribution can be calibrated with a significantly smaller set of simulations than would be needed to construct a precise power spectrum. By connecting the acoustic signature in the Fourier basis with that in the configuration basis, we show that the acoustic signature is more robust than the usual Fourier-space intuition would suggest because the beat frequency between the peaks and troughs of the acoustic oscillations is a very small wavenumber that is well inside the linear regime. We argue that any possible shift of the acoustic scale is related to infall on 150 Mpc scale, which is O(0.5\%) fractionally at first-order even at z = 0. For the matter, there is a first-order cancellation such that the mean shift is O(10 -4). However, galaxy bias can circumvent this cancellation and produce a sub-percent systematic bias.

We show that the non-linear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the non-linearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4.

  abstract = {We provide scaling relations and fitting formulae for adiabatic cold dark matter cosmologies that account for all baryon effects in the matter transfer function to better than 10\% in the large-scale structure regime. They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold-dark-matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction {$\Omega$} b /{$\Omega$} 0 {$\sim$} {$>$} {$\Omega$} 0 h 2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter {$\Gamma$}.

We use ensembled deep learning algorithms to produce a fast emulator of an updated version of the GALFORM model from a small number of training examples. We use the emulator to explore the model's parameter space, and apply sensitivity analysis techniques to better understand the relative importance of the model parameters. We uncover key tensions between observational datasets by applying a heuristic weighting scheme in a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework and exploring the effects of requiring improved fits to certain datasets relative to others. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method can be used to successfully calibrate the model parameters to a comprehensive list of observational constraints. In doing so, we re-discover previous GALFORM fits in an automatic and transparent way, and discover an improved fit by applying a heavier weighting to the fit to the metallicities of early-type galaxies. The deep learning emulator requires a fraction of the model evaluations needed in similar emulation approaches, achieving an out-of-sample mean absolute error at the knee of the K-band luminosity function of 0.06 dex with less than 1000 model evaluations. We demonstrate that this is an extremely efficient, inexpensive and transparent way to explore multi-dimensional parameter spaces, and can be applied more widely beyond semi-analytical galaxy formation models.},

In particular, we quantify environmental effects on satellite populations from TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300 located within the virial radius of group- and clusterlike hosts with total masses of 1012-15.2 M{$\odot$}. At fixed stellar mass, the satellite SHMR exhibits a distinct shift towards lower dynamical mass compared to the SHMR of centrals. Conversely, at fixed dynamical mass, satellite galaxies appear to have larger stellar-to-total mass fractions than centrals by up to a factor of a few. The systematic deviation from the central SHMR is larger for satellites in more massive hosts, at smaller cluster-centric distances, with earlier infall times, and that inhabits higher local density environments; moreover, it is in place already at early times (z 2). Systematic environmental effects might contribute to the perceived galaxy-to-galaxy variation in the measured SHMR when galaxies cannot be separated into satellites and centrals. The SHMR of satellites exhibits a larger scatter than centrals (by up to {$\sim$}0.8 dex), over the whole range of dynamical mass. The shift of the satellite SHMR results mostly from tidal stripping of their dark matter, which affects satellites in an outside-in fashion: The departure of the satellite SHMR from the centrals' relation diminishes for measurements of dynamical mass in progressively smaller apertures. Finally, we provide a family of fitting functions for the SHMR predicted by IllustrisTNG.},

The majority of the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) is white and attend top-ranked institutions. Within the GRFP, there is a clear disconnect between the grantee's proposed broader impacts and follow-through. To value and support communities, and graduate students of color in the process, the GRFP must be reimagined. In this article, we provide a brief background on the relationship between STEM and marginalized communities, and how broader impacts currently function as a band-aid to the issues of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) in STEM. We then conclude by providing recommendations to improve the broader impacts section and the awardee selection process.},

Viewed from a perspective of social influence, this pattern suggests that URMs do not integrate into the STEM academic community at the same rate as non-URM students. Estrada and colleagues recently showed that Kelman's tripartite integration model of social influence (TIMSI) predicted URM persistence into science fields. In this paper, we longitudinally examine the integration of URMs into the STEM community by using growth-curve analyses to measure the development of TIMIS's key variables (science efficacy, identity, and values) from junior year through the postbaccalaureate year. Results showed that quality mentorship and research experience occurring in the junior and senior years were positively related to student science efficacy, identity, and values at that same time period. Longitudinal modeling of TIMSI further shows that, while efficacy is important, and perhaps a necessary predictor of moving toward a STEM career, past experiences of efficacy may not be sufficient for maintaining longer-term persistence. In contrast, science identity and values do continue to be predictive of STEM career pathway persistence up to 4 years after graduation.},

We investigate the impact of initial velocity and density field information on the construction of halo mass function (HMF) through cosmological \$N\$-body simulations.

Our results show a negligible improvement from including the velocity in addition to the density information when considering simulations based on (\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM) with the amplitude of initial scalar perturbations \$A\_s = 2\textbackslash times10\^\{-9\}\$. To investigate the effect of the initial velocity field in constructing the halo mass function, we increase the initial power spectrum such that we see the effect of velocities in larger halos visible to the resolution of our simulations. The CNN model trained on the simulation snapshots with large \$A\_s\$ shows a considerable improvement in the HMF prediction when adding the velocity field information. Eventually, for the simulation with \$A\_s = 8 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-8\}\$, the model trained with only density information shows at least \$80\textbackslash\%\$ increase in the mean squared error relative to the model with both velocity and density information, which indicates the failure of the density-only model to predict the halo mass function in this case.

Abstract Analyzing and synthesizing point distributions are of central importance for a wide range of problems in computer graphics. Existing synthesis algorithms can only generate white or blue-noise distributions with characteristics dictated by the underlying processes used, and analysis tools have not been focused on exploring relations among distributions. We propose a unified analysis and general synthesis algorithms for point distributions. We employ the pair correlation function as the basis of our methods and design synthesis algorithms that can generate distributions with given target characteristics, possibly extracted from an example point set, and introduce a unified characterization of distributions by mapping them to a space implied by pair correlations. The algorithms accept example and output point sets of different sizes and dimensions , are applicable to multi-class distributions and non-Euclidean domains, simple to implement and run in O(n) time. We illustrate applications of our method to real world distributions.},

It is constructed using the uncertainty quantification software UQLab using a spectral decomposition method called polynomial chaos expansion. All steps in its construction have been tested and optimized: the large high-resolution N-body simulations carried out with PKDGRAV3 were validated using a simulation from the Euclid Flagship campaign and demonstrated to have converged up to wavenumbers k {$\approx$} 5 h Mpc -1 for redshifts z {$\leq$} 5. The emulator is based on 100 input cosmologies simulated in boxes of (1250Mpc/h) 3 using 2048 3 particles. We show that by creating mock emulators it is possible to successfully predict and optimize the performance of the final emulator prior to performing any N-body simulations. The absolute accuracy of the final nonlinear power spectrum is as good as one obtained with N-body simulations, conservatively, {$\sim$} 1\% for k 1 h Mpc -1 and z 1. This enables efficient forward modeling in the nonlinear regime allowing for estimation of cosmological parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. EuclidEmulator has been compared to HALOFIT, CosmicEmu and NGenHalofit, and shown to be more accurate than these other approaches. This work paves a new way for optimal construction of future emulators that also consider other cosmological ob-servables, use higher resolution input simulations and investigate higher dimensional cosmological parameter spaces.},

In order to achieve this level of accuracy, we have had to improve the quality of the underlying N-body simulations used as training data: (i) we use self-consistent linear evolution of non-dark matter species such as massive neutrinos, photons, dark energy, and the metric field, (ii) we perform the simulations in the so-called N-body gauge, which allows one to interpret the results in the framework of general relativity, (iii) we run over 250 high-resolution simulations with 30003 particles in boxes of 1(h-1 Gpc)3 volumes based on paired-and-fixed initial conditions, and (iv) we provide a resolution correction that can be applied to emulated results as a post-processing step in order to drastically reduce systematic biases on small scales due to residual resolution effects in the simulations.

We show based on a set of N-body simulations that the matter distribution is anisotropic out to 150 h -1 Mpc, far beyond the BAO scale of 100 h -1 Mpc, and discuss implications for the measurement of the BAO. To that purpose we use alignment correlation functions, i.e., cross-correlation functions between high density peaks and the overall matter distribution measured along the orientation of the peaks and perpendicular to it. The correlation function measured along (perpendicular to) the orientation of high density peaks is enhanced (reduced) by a factor of two compared to the conventional correlation function and the location of the BAO peak shifts toward smaller (larger) scales if measured along (perpendicular to) the orientation of the high density peaks. Similar effects are expected to shape observed galaxy correlation functions at BAO scales. \textcopyright{} 2012. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

Hundreds of quasars have been discovered in the first billion years of cosmic history, with the quasar redshift frontier extended to z\textasciitilde 7.6. Observations of quasars at cosmic dawn show that: (1) The number density of luminous quasars declines exponentially at z{$>$}5, suggesting that the earliest quasars emerge at z\textasciitilde 10; the lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution indicates a rapid buildup of the AGN environment. (2) Billion-solar-mass BHs already exist at z{$>$}7.5; they must form and grow in less than 700 Myr, by a combination of massive early BH seeds with highly efficient and sustained accretion. (3) The rapid quasar growth is accompanied by strong star formation and feedback activity in their host galaxies, which show diverse morphological and kinetic properties, with typical dynamical mass of lower than that implied by the local BH/galaxy scaling relations. (4) HI absorption in quasar spectra probes the tail end of cosmic reionization at z\textasciitilde 5.3-6, and indicates the EoR midpoint at 6.9 {$<$} z {$<$} 7.6 with large spatial fluctuations in IGM ionization. Observations of heavy element absorption lines suggest that the circumgalactic medium also experiences evolution in its ionization structure and metal enrichment during the EoR.},

  abstract = {The origin of the bulk of the astrophysical neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory remains a mystery. Previous source-finding analyses compare the directions of IceCube events and individual sources in astrophysical catalogs. The source association method is technically challenging when the number of source candidates is much larger than the number of the observed astrophysical neutrinos. We show that in this large source number regime, a cross-correlation analysis of neutrino data and source catalog can instead be used to constrain potential source populations for the high-energy astro-physical neutrinos, and provide spatial evidence for the existence of astrophysical neutrinos. We present an analysis of the cross-correlation of the IceCube 2010-2012 point-source data and a WISE-2MASS galaxy sample. While we find no significant detection of cross-correlation with the publicly available neutrino dataset, we show that, when applied to the full IceCube data, which has a longer observation time and higher astrophysical neutrino purity, our method has sufficient statistical power to detect a cross-correlation signal if the neutrino sources trace the Large Scale Structure of the Universe.},

Pico is a general purpose machine learning code which we have applied to computing the CMB power spectra and the WMAP likelihood. For this release, we have made improvements to the algorithm as well as the data sets used to train Pico, leading to a significant improvement in accuracy. For the 9 parameter nonflat case presented here Pico can on average compute the TT, TE and EE spectra to better than 1\% of cosmic standard deviation for nearly all {$\mathscr{l}$} values over a large region of parameter space. Performing a cosmological parameter analysis of current CMB and large scale structure data, we show that these power spectra give very accurate 1 and 2 dimensional parameter posteriors. We have extended Pico to allow computation of the tensor power spectrum and the matter transfer function. Pico runs about 1500 times faster than CAMB at the default accuracy and about 250, 000 times faster at high accuracy. Training Pico can be done using massively parallel computing resources, including distributed computing projects such as Cosmology@Home. On the homepage for Pico, located at http://cosmos.astro.uiuc.edu/pico, we provide new sets of regression coefficients and make the training code available for public use.},

This algorithm, called Pico, can compute the CMB power spectrum and matter transfer function as well as any computationally expensive likelihoods in a few milliseconds. By removing these bottlenecks from parameter estimation codes, Pico decreases their computational time by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. Pico has several important properties. First, it is extremely fast and accurate over a large volume of parameter space. Furthermore, its accuracy can continue to be improved by using a larger training set. This method is generalizable to an arbitrary number of cosmological parameters and to any range of {$\mathscr{l}$}-values in multipole space. Pico is approximately 3000 times faster than CAMB for flat models, and approximately 2000 times faster then the WMAP 3 year likelihood code.

We present a novel approach to this class of problem, based on neural networks using a generalized attention mechanism, that we call symmetry preserving attention networks (spa-net). We train one such network to identify the decay products of each top quark unambiguously and without combinatorial explosion as an example of the power of this technique. This approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, correctly assigning all jets in 80.7\% of 6-jet, 66.8\% of 7-jet, and 52.3\% of {$\geq$}8-jet events respectively.},

In this paper, we explain why the quality of the shape measurement does not only depend on the numerical resolution, but also on the density gradient. In particular, this can limit the quality of measurements in the central regions of haloes. We propose a criterion to estimate the sensitivity of the measured shapes based on the density gradient of the halo and to apply it to cosmological simulations of collisionless and self-interacting dark matter. By this, we demonstrate where reliable measurements of the halo shape are possible and how cored density profiles limit their applicability.},

The models include different prescriptions for galactic outflows, namely hybrid energy/momentum driven wind (ezw), and constant winds (cw). We extract for comparison direct observables including equivalent widths, covering factors, ion ratios, and kinematics. Both wind models are generally in good agreement with these observations for HI and certain low ionization metal lines, but show poorer agreement with higher ionization metal lines including SiIII and OVI that are well-observed by COS-Halos. These discrepancies suggest that both wind models predict too much cool, metal-enriched gas and not enough hot gas, and/or that the metals are not sufficiently well-mixed. This may reflect our model assumption of ejecting outflows as cool and unmixing gas. Our ezw simulation includes a heuristic prescription to quench massive galaxies by super-heating its ISM gas, which we show yields sufficient low ionisation absorption to be broadly consistent with observations, but also substantial OVI absorption that is inconsistent with data, suggesting that gas around quenched galaxies in the real Universe does not cool. At impact parameters of {$<$}50 kpc, recycling winds dominate the absorption of low ions and even HI, while OVI almost always arises from metals ejected longer than 1 Gyr ago. The similarity between the wind models is surprising, since we show that they differ substantially in their predicted amount and phase distribution of halo gas. We show that this similarity owes mainly to our comparison here at fixed stellar mass rather than at fixed halo mass in our previous works, which suggests that CGM properties are more closely tied to the stellar mass of galaxies rather than halo mass.},

Using lines of sight (LOS) targeted at impact parameters out to 1 Mpc around galaxies with a range of halo masses, we study the physical conditions and their variation with impact parameter b and line-of-sight velocity in the CGM as traced by HI, MgII, SiIV, CIV, OVI, and NeVIII absorbers. All ions show a strong excess of absorption near galaxies compared to random LOS. The excess continues beyond 1 Mpc, reflecting the correlation of metal absorption with large-scale structure. Absorption is particularly enhanced within \textasciitilde{} 300 km/s and 300 kpc of galaxies, roughly delineating the CGM; this range contains the majority of global metal absorption. The different behaviour of low ionisation potential species versus high ionisation potential species can be understood as low ionisation potential species tracing denser areas closer to galaxies, versus high ionisation potential species tracing more diffusely distributed gas. Photo-ionisation is the driver of this trend where lower ionisation potential species decline rapidly with increasing b while OVI and even weak NeVIII show comparatively flat radial dependencies. In addition, collisionally ionised OVI and strong NeVIII trace hot CGM gas when present in higher mass halos at b \textbackslash leq 100 kpc. Lower ionisation potential metals show little temperature dependence with b, while OVI and especially NeVIII trace hotter gas when present at lower b. Larger halo masses generally produce more absorption. These findings arise using our favored outflow scalings as expected for momentum-driven winds; with no winds, the CGM gas remains mostly unenriched, while outflows with constant velocity and mass loading factor show subtle differences.},

We categorize inflowing, outflowing, and ambient gas based on its history and fate as tracked in our simulation. Following our earlier work showing that the ionisation level of absorbers was a primary factor in determining the physical conditions of absorbing gas, we show here that it is also a governing factor for its dynamical state. Low-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. MgII) tend to arise in gas that will fall onto galaxies within several Gyr, while high-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. OVI) generally trace material that was deposited by outflows many Gyr ago. Inflowing gas is dominated by enriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow, hence accretion at low redshifts is typically substantially enriched. Recycling wind material is preferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-mass halos since high-mass halos have more hot gas that is able to support itself against infall. Low-mass halos also tend to re-eject more of their accreted material, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher mass loading factors for lower-mass galaxies. Typical HI absorbers trace unenriched ambient material that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger HI absorbers arise in cool, enriched inflowing gas. Instantaneous radial velocity measures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing between inflowing and outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows. These results suggest that probing halo gas using a range of absorbers can provide detailed information about the amount and physical conditions of material that is participating in the baryon cycle.},

However, the large cosmic variance from primary CMB fluctuations limits the usefulness of this effect in constraining dark energy or modified gravity. In this paper, we propose a novel method to separate the ISW signal from the primary signal using gravitational lensing, based on the fact that the ISW signal is, to a good approximation, not gravitationally lensed. We forecast how well we can isolate the ISW signal for different experimental configurations, and discuss various applications, including modified gravity, large-scale CMB anomalies, and measurements of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity. Although not within reach of current experiments, the proposed method is a unique way to remove the cosmic variance of the primary signal, allowing for better CMB-based constraints on late-time phenomena than previously thought possible.},

  abstract = {We introduce the SE(3)-Transformer, a variant of the self-attention module for 3D point clouds and graphs, which is equivariant under continuous 3D roto-translations. Equivariance is important to ensure stable and predictable performance in the presence of nuisance transformations of the data input. A positive corollary of equivariance is increased weight-tying within the model. The SE(3)-Transformer leverages the benefits of self-attention to operate on large point clouds and graphs with varying number of points, while guaranteeing SE(3)-equivariance for robustness. We evaluate our model on a toy N-body particle simulation dataset, showcasing the robustness of the predictions under rotations of the input. We further achieve competitive performance on two real-world datasets, ScanObjectNN and QM9. In all cases, our model outperforms a strong, non-equivariant attention baseline and an equivariant model without attention.},

Intriguingly, we find similar correlations between residuals in SMHM in the SAM and in TNG, suggesting that these relations may be shaped by similar physical processes. Other scaling relations do not show significant correlations in the residuals, indicating that the physics implementations in the SAM and TNG are significantly different.},

  abstract = {Article published by EDP Sciences, to be cited as https://doi. ABSTRACT The Gaia Galactic survey mission is designed and optimized to obtain astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy of nearly two billion stars in our Galaxy. Yet as an all-sky multi-epoch survey, Gaia also observes several million extragalactic objects down to a magnitude of G {$\sim$} 21 mag. Due to the nature of the Gaia onboard-selection algorithms, these are mostly point-source-like objects. Using data provided by the satellite, we have identified quasar and galaxy candidates via supervised machine learning methods, and estimate their redshifts using the low resolution BP/RP spectra. We further characterise the surface brightness profiles of host galaxies of quasars and of galaxies from pre-defined input lists. Here we give an overview of the processing of extragalactic objects, describe the data products in Gaia DR3, and analyse their properties. Two integrated tables contain the main results for a high completeness, but low purity (50-70\%), set of 6.6 million candidate quasars and 4.8 million candidate galaxies. We provide queries that select purer sub-samples of these containing 1.9 million probable quasars and 2.9 million probable galaxies (both {$\sim$}95\% purity). We also use high quality BP/RP spectra of 43 thousand high probability quasars over the redshift range 0.05-4.36 to construct a composite quasar spectrum spanning restframe wavelengths from 72-1000 nm.},

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.},

  abstract = {The outcome of upcoming cosmological surveys will depend on the accurate estimates of photometric redshifts. In the framework of the implementation of the photometric redshift algorithm for the ESA Euclid Mission, we are exploring new avenues to improve current template-fitting methods. This paper focusses in particular on the prescription of the extinction of a source light by dust in the Milky Way. Since Galactic extinction strongly correlates with wavelength and photometry is commonly obtained through broad-band filters, the amount of absorption depends on the source intrinsic spectral energy distribution (SED), a point however neglected as the source SED is not known a-priori. A consequence of this dependence is that the observed E B-V (= A B - A V) will in general be different from the E B-V used to normalise the Galactic absorption law k {$\lambda$} (= A {$\lambda$} /E B-V). Band-pass corrections are thus required to adequately renormalise the law for a given SED. In this work, we assess the band-pass corrections of a range of SEDs and find they vary by up to 20\%. We have investigated how neglecting these corrections biases the calibration of dust into reddening map and how the scaling of the map depends of the sources used for its calibration. We derive dust-to-reddening scaling factors from the colour excesses of z {$<$} 0.4 SDSS red galaxies and show that band-pass corrections predict the observed differences. Extinction corrections are then estimated for a range of SEDs and a set of optical to near-infrared filters relevant to Euclid and upcoming cosmological ground-based surveys. For high extinction line-of-sights (E B-V {$>$} 0.1, {$\sim$} 8\% of the Euclid Wide survey), the variations in corrections can be up to 0.1 mag in the 'bluer' optical filters (ugr) and up to 0.04 mag in the near-infrared filters. We find that an inaccurate correction of Galactic extinction critically affects photometric redshift estimates. In particular, for high extinction lines of sights and z {$<$} 0.5, the bias (i.e. the mean {$\increment$}z = z phot - z real) exceeds 0.2\%(1 + z), the precision required for weak-lensing analyses. Additional uncertainty on the parametrisation of the Milky Way extinction curve itself further reduces the photometric redshift precision. We propose a new prescription of Galactic absorption for template-fitting algorithms which takes into consideration the dependence of extinction with SED.},

  abstract = {Modified gravity and massive neutrino cosmologies are two of the most interesting scenarios that have been recently explored to account for possible observational deviations from the concordance {$\Lambda$}-cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) model. In this context, we investigated the large-scale structure of the Universe by exploiting the DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder simulations that implement, simultaneously, the effects of f (R) gravity and massive neutrinos. To study the possibility of breaking the degeneracy between these two effects, we analysed the redshift-space distortions in the clustering of dark matter haloes at different redshifts. Specifically, we focused on the monopole and quadrupole of the two-point correlation function, both in real and redshift space. The deviations with respect to {$\Lambda$}CDM model have been quantified in terms of the linear growth rate parameter. We found that redshift-space distortions provide a powerful probe to discriminate between {$\Lambda$}CDM and modified gravity models, especially at high redshift (z 1), even in the presence of massive neutrinos.},

The new data systematically finds positive correlations, indicating a rapid slow down in the growth of structure in the universe. Individual cross-correlation measurements are of low significance, but we show that combining data at different redshifts introduces important new constraints. Contrary to what happens at low redshifts, for a fixed {$\Omega$} m , the higher the dark energy contend, {$\Omega$} {$\Lambda$} , the lower the ISW cross-correlation amplitude. At 68\% confidence level, the data finds new independent evidence of dark energy: {$\Omega$} {$\Lambda$} = 0.42 - 1.22. It also confirms, to higher significance, the presence of a large dark matter component: {$\Omega$} m = 0.18 - 0.34, exceeding the density of baryonic matter, but far from the critical value. Combining these new constraints with the prior of a flat universe, or the prior of an accelerating universe provides strong new evidence for a dark cosmos. Combination with supernova data yields {$\Omega$} {$\Lambda$} = 0.71 {$\pm$} 0.13, {$\Omega$} m = 0.29 {$\pm$} 0.04. If we also assume a flat universe, we find {$\Omega$} {$\Lambda$} = 0.70 {$\pm$} 0.05 and w = -1.02 {$\pm$} 0.17 for a constant dark energy equation of state.},

  abstract = {We study the stellar angular momentum of thousands of galaxies in the Illustris cosmological simulation, which captures gravitational and gas dynamics within galaxies, as well as feedback from stars and black holes. We find that the angular momentum of the simulated galaxies matches observations well, and in particular two distinct relations are found for late-type versus early-type galaxies. The relation for late-type galaxies corresponds to the value expected from full conservation of the specific angular momentum generated by cosmological tidal torques. The relation for early-type galaxies corresponds to retention of only {$\sim$}30\% of that, but we find that those early-type galaxies with low angular momentum at z = 0 nevertheless reside at high redshift on the late-type relation. Some of them abruptly lose angular momentum during major mergers. To gain further insight, we explore the scaling relations in simulations where the galaxy formation physics is modified with respect to the fiducial model. We find that galactic winds with high mass-loading factors are essential for obtaining the high angular momentum relation typical for late-type galaxies, while active galactic nucleus feedback largely operates in the opposite direction. Hence, feedback controls the stellar angular momentum of galaxies, and appears to be instrumental for establishing the Hubble sequence.},

Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2 \texttimes{} 18203 resolution elements in a (106.5 Mpc)3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z = 0 using the AREPO moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z = 0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z = 7 to 0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z = 4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their haloes for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star formation rates up to z = 8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z = 5 to 0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in Hubble Space Telescope mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z = 2 to their z = 0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z = 0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star formation activity and compactness. We conclude with a discussion of several disagreements with observations, and lay out possible directions for future research.},

  abstract = {We study the chaotic-like behavior of cosmological simulations by quantifying how minute perturbations grow over time and manifest as macroscopic differences in galaxy properties. When we run pairs of 'shadow' simulations that are identical except for random minute initial displacements to particle positions (e.g. of order 1e-7pc), the results diverge from each other at the individual galaxy level (while the statistical properties of the ensemble of galaxies are unchanged). After cosmological times, the global properties of pairs of 'shadow' galaxies that are matched between the simulations differ from each other generally at a level of \textasciitilde 2-25\%, depending on the considered physical quantity. We perform these experiments using cosmological volumes of (25-50Mpc/h)\^3 evolved either purely with dark matter, or with baryons and star-formation but no feedback, or using the full feedback model of the IllustrisTNG project. The runs cover four resolution levels spanning a factor of 512 in mass. We find that without feedback the differences between shadow galaxies generally become smaller as the resolution increases, but with the IllustrisTNG model the results are mostly converging towards a 'floor'. This hints at the role of feedback in setting the chaotic properties of galaxy formation. Importantly, we compare the macroscopic differences between shadow galaxies to the overall scatter in various galaxy scaling relations, and conclude that for the star formation-mass and the Tully-Fisher relations the butterfly effect in our simulations contributes significantly to the overall scatter. We find that our results are robust to whether random numbers are used in the sub-grid models or not. We discuss the implications for galaxy formation theory in general and for cosmological simulations in particular.},

  abstract = {Multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers offer a promising path towards resolution of the Hubble constant (\$H\_0\$) tension, provided their constraints are shown to be free from systematics such as the Malmquist bias. In the traditional Bayesian framework, accounting for selection effects in the likelihood requires calculation of the expected number (or fraction) of detections as a function of the parameters describing the population and cosmology; a potentially costly and/or inaccurate process. This calculation can, however, be bypassed completely by performing the inference in a framework in which the likelihood is never explicitly calculated, but instead fit using forward simulations of the data, which naturally include the selection. This is Likelihood-Free Inference (LFI). Here, we use density-estimation LFI, coupled to neural-network-based data compression, to infer \$H\_0\$ from mock catalogues of binary neutron star mergers, given noisy redshift, distance and peculiar velocity estimates for each object. We demonstrate that LFI yields statistically unbiased estimates of \$H\_0\$ in the presence of selection effects, with precision matching that of sampling the full Bayesian hierarchical model. Marginalizing over the bias increases the \$H\_0\$ uncertainty by only \$6\textbackslash\%\$ for training sets consisting of \$O(10\^4)\$ populations. The resulting LFI framework is applicable to population-level inference problems with selection effects across astrophysics.},

We adopt an uniform and sim-plistic approach to produce synthetic observations at various wavelengths, and we compare the detection chances of different combinations of observables correlated with each other and with the underlying galaxy distribution in the volume. With presently available surveys of galaxies and existing instruments, the best chances to detect the diffuse gas in the cosmic web outside of halos is by cross-correlating the distribution of galaxies with Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations. We also find that the cross-correlation between the galaxy network and the radio emission or the Faraday Rotation can already be used to limit the amplitude of extragalactic magnetic fields, well outside of the cluster volume usually explored by existing radio observations , and to probe the origin of cosmic magnetism with the future generation of radio surveys.},

However, learning a VAE from data poses still unanswered theoretical questions and considerable practical challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative framework for generative modeling that is simpler, easier to train, and deterministic, yet has many of the advantages of VAEs. We observe that sampling a stochastic encoder in a Gaussian VAE can be interpreted as simply injecting noise into the input of a deterministic decoder. We investigate how substituting this kind of stochasticity, with other explicit and implicit regularization schemes, can lead to an equally smooth and meaningful latent space without forcing it to conform to an arbitrarily chosen prior. To retrieve a generative mechanism to sample new data, we introduce an ex-post density estimation step that can be readily applied also to existing VAEs, improving their sample quality. We show, in a rigorous empirical study, that the proposed regularized deterministic autoencoders are able to generate samples that are comparable to, or better than, those of VAEs and more powerful alternatives when applied to images as well as to structured data such as molecules. \textbackslash footnote\{An implementation is available at: \textbackslash url\{https://github.com/ParthaEth/Regularized\_autoencoders-RAE-\}\}},

By including a range of suitably modified initial conditions in the simulations, and rescaling the resulting emulator predictions with analytical 'halo model reactions', accurate non-linear matter power spectra for general extensions to the standard {$\Lambda$}CDM model can be calculated. We optimize the emulator design by substituting the simulation suite with non-linear predictions from the standard HALOFIT tool. We review the performance of the emulator for artificially generated departures from the standard cosmology as well as for theoretically motivated models, such as f(R) gravity and massive neutrinos. For the majority of cosmologies we have tested, the emulator can reproduce the matter power spectrum with errors {$\lessequivlnt$}1 per cent deep into the highly non-linear regime. This work demonstrates that with a well-designed suite of {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations, extensions to the standard cosmological model can be tested in the non-linear regime without any reliance on expensive beyond-{$\Lambda$}CDM simulations.},

However, the expected signal is typically orders of magnitude smaller than instrumental systematics, and the results are crucially dependent on the treatment of the latter. In this paper, we propose a new method to infer transit parameters in the presence of systematic noise using Gaussian processes, a technique widely used in the machine learning community for Bayesian regression and classification problems. Our method makes use of auxiliary information about the state of the instrument, but does so in a non-parametric manner, without imposing a specific dependence of the systematics on the instrumental parameters, and naturally allows for the correlated nature of the noise. We give an example application of the method to archival NICMOS transmission spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter HD 189733, which goes some way towards reconciling the controversy surrounding this dataset in the literature. Finally, we provide an appendix giving a general introduction to Gaussian processes for regression, in order to encourage their application to a wider range of problems.},

The host star, TOI-700 (TIC 150428135), is a nearby (31.1 pc), inactive, M2.5 dwarf (\$V\_\{mag\} = 13.15\$). TOI-700 is already known to host three planets, including the small, HZ planet, TOI-700 d. The new planet has an orbital period of 27.8 days and, based on its radius (0.95 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$), it is likely rocky. TOI-700 was observed for 21 sectors over Years 1 and 3 of the TESS mission, including 10 sectors at 20-second cadence in Year 3. Using this full set of TESS data and additional follow-up observations, we identify, validate, and characterize TOI-700 e. This discovery adds another world to the short list of small, HZ planets transiting nearby and bright host stars. Such systems, where the stars are bright enough that follow-up observations are possible to constrain planet masses and atmospheres using current and future facilities, are incredibly valuable. The presence of multiple small, HZ planets makes this system even more enticing for follow-up observations.},

As survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical data bases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based method to identify anomalies in large data sets to facilitate such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence light curves from NASA's Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the Kepler long cadence light curves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly, Boyajian's star (KIC 8462852), as a rare `ground truth' for testing outlier identification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are included among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behaviour in Boyajian's star; we report the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a sample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects that are rare in the Kepler field, and data artefacts. By identifying {$<$}4 per cent of each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel phenomena.},

The advent of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations enables such predictions on sufficiently sizeable volumes. Aims. Lensing quantities (deflection, shear, convergence) and their statistics (convergence power spectrum, shear correlation functions , galaxy-galaxy lensing) are computed in the past lightcone built in the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, which implements our best knowledge on baryonic physics at the galaxy scale in order to mimic galaxy populations over cosmic time. Methods. Lensing quantities are generated over a one square degree field of view by performing multiple-lens plane ray-tracing through the lightcone, taking full advantage of the 1 kpc resolution and splitting the line of sight over 500 planes all the way to redshift z {$\sim$} 7. Two methods are explored (standard projection of particles with adaptive smoothing, and integration of the acceleration field) to assert a good implementation. The focus is on small scales where baryons matter most. Results. Standard cosmic shear statistics are impacted at the 10\% level by the baryonic component for angular scales below a few arcmin. The galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, or galaxy-shear correlation function, is consistent with measurements for the redshift z {$\sim$} 0.5 massive galaxy population. At higher redshift z 1, the impact of magnification bias on this correlation is relevant for separations greater than 1 Mpc. Conclusions. This work is pivotal for all current and upcoming weak lensing surveys and represents a first step towards building a full end-to-end generation of lensed mock images from large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.},

Harnessing the exquisite spatial resolution ({$\sim$}0.5 arcsec) afforded by the first {$\sim$}170 deg 2 of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, we present our new constraints on the importance of galaxy-galaxy major mergers (1:4) in growing BHs throughout the last {$\sim$}8 Gyrs. Utilizing mid-infrared observations in the WISE All-Sky survey, we robustly select active galactic nuclei (AGN) and mass-matched control galaxy samples, totaling {$\sim$}140,000 spectroscopically confirmed systems at i {$<$} 22 mag. We identify galaxy interaction signatures using a novel machine-learning random forest decision tree technique allowing us to select statistically significant samples of major-mergers, minor-mergers/irregular-systems, and non-interacting galaxies. We use these samples to show that galaxies undergoing mergers are a factor {$\sim$} 2 - 7 more likely to contain luminous obscured AGN than non-interacting galaxies, and this is independent of both stellar mass and redshift to z {$<$} 0.9. Furthermore, based on our comparison of AGN fractions in mass-matched samples, we determine that the most luminous AGN population (L AGN 10 45 erg s -1) systematically reside in merging systems over non-interacting galaxies. Our findings show that galaxy-galaxy interactions do, on average, trigger luminous AGN activity substantially more often than in secularly evolving non-interacting galaxies, and we further suggest that the BH growth rate may be closely tied to the dynamical time of the merger system.},

  abstract = {In December 2010, NASA created a Science Definition Team (SDT) for WFIRST, the Wide Field Infra-Red Survey Telescope, recommended by the Astro 2010 Decadal Survey as the highest priority for a large space mission. The SDT was chartered to work with the WFIRST Project Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL to produce a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for WFIRST. Part of the original charge was to produce an interim design reference mission by mid-2011. That document was delivered to NASA and widely circulated within the astronomical community. In late 2011 the Astrophysics Division augmented its original charge, asking for two design reference missions. The first of these, DRM1, was to be a finalized version of the interim DRM, reducing overall mission costs where possible. The second of these, DRM2, was to identify and eliminate capabilities that overlapped with those of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (henceforth JWST), ESA's Euclid mission, and the NSF's ground-based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (henceforth LSST), and again to reduce overall mission cost, while staying faithful to NWNH. This report presents both DRM1 and DRM2.},

The results obtained demonstrate that the two clusters are embedded in a common supercluster of very large extent. It is found that there are three observationally distinct populations of galaxies within this supercluster, including galaxies located in the two rich cluster cores, those located in intermediate- or low-mass clusters, and a nearly homogeneously distributed population of isolated galaxies; in addition, a population of foreground galaxies located in low-mass clusters rather than being distributed in a homogeneous 'field' is also identified. The redshift of formation for the foreground groups is estimated to be no more than about 9, and the morphology of the galaxies is examined. It is suggested that every nearby very rich cluster is located in a supercluster and that all clusters of richness class greater than or equal to 2 will eventually be found to lie in superclusters.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the redshift-space galaxy clustering have been a prolific source of cosmological information in recent years. Accurate covariance estimates are an essential step for the validation of galaxy clustering models of the redshift-space two-point statistics. Usually, only a limited set of accurate N-body simulations is available. Thus, assessing the data covariance is not possible or only leads to a noisy estimate. Further, relying on simulated realisations of the survey data means that tests of the cosmol-ogy dependence of the covariance are expensive. With these points in mind, this work presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of anisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues. Considering the Legendre moments ('multipoles') of the two-point statistics and projections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter ('clustering wedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic clustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case of a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of this paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space covariance matrices. To validate our model, we create synthetic HOD galaxy catalogues by populating the haloes of an ensemble of large-volume N-body simulations. Using linear and non-linear input power spectra, we find very good agreement between the model predictions and the measurements on the synthetic catalogues in the quasi-linear regime.},

  abstract = {Studies investigating the relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and AGN power often rely on averaging techniques -- such as stacking -- to incorporate information from non-detections. However, averages, and especially means, can be strongly affected by outliers and can therefore give a misleading indication of the "typical" case. Recently, a number of studies have taken a step further by binning their sample in terms of AGN power, and investigating how the SFR distribution differs between these bins. These bin thresholds are often weakly motivated, and binning implicitly assumes that sources within the same bin have similar (or even identical) properties. In this paper, we investigate whether the main sequence-normalised SFR (i.e., starburstiness, \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm MS\}\$) distribution changes continuously as a function of AGN power, using a hierarchical Bayesian model that completely removes the need to bin. In doing so, we find strong evidence that the \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm MS\}\$ distribution changes with AGN power, such that higher X-ray luminosity AGNs have a tighter physical connection to the star forming process than lower luminosity AGNs.},

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only poor samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models with continuous generators. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms. \textdagger},

Although both models have been independently calibrated to match observations, rather than each other, we find good agreement between the two models for two-point clustering and galaxy assembly bias signatures. The models also show a qualitatively similar response of occupancy and clustering to secondary halo paramaters other than mass, such as formation history and concentration, although with some quantitative differences. Thus, our results demonstrate that the galaxy-halo relationships in SC-SAM and TNG are quite similar to first order. However, we also find areas in which the models differ. For example, we note a strong correlation between halo gas content and environment in TNG, which is lacking in the SC-SAM, as well as differences in the occupancy predictions for low-mass haloes. Moreover, we show that higher-order statistics, such as cumulants of the density field, help to accurately describe the galaxy distribution and discriminate between models that show degenerate behavior for two-point statistics. Our results suggest that SAMs are a promising cost-effective and intuitive method for generating mock catalogues for next generation cosmological surveys.},

This assumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood free inferences such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make inference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead ABC relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring the distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter haloes with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected 'true' HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the 'true' HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately, our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology provides fundamental stellar parameters independent of distance, but subject to systematics under calibration. Gaia DR2 has provided parallaxes for a billion stars, which are offset by a parallax zero-point (zp). Red Clump (RC) stars have a narrow spread in luminosity, thus functioning as standard candles to calibrate these systematics. This work measures how the magnitude and spread of the RC in the Kepler field are affected by changes to temperature and scaling relations for seismology, and changes to the parallax zero-point for Gaia. We use a sample of 5576 RC stars classified through asteroseismology. We apply hierarchical Bayesian latent variable models, finding the population level properties of the RC with seismology, and use those as priors on Gaia parallaxes to find zp. We then find the position of the RC using published values for zp. We find a seismic temperature insensitive spread of the RC of {$\sim$} 0.03 mag in the 2MASS K band and a larger and slightly temperature-dependent spread of {$\sim$} 0.13 mag in the Gaia G band. This intrinsic dispersion in the K band provides a distance precision of {$\sim$} 1\% for RC stars. Using Gaia data alone, we find a mean zero-point of -41 {$\pm$} 10 \textmu as. This offset yields RC absolute magnitudes of -1.634 {$\pm$} 0.018 in K and 0.546 {$\pm$} 0.016 in G. Obtaining these same values through seismology would require a global temperature shift of {$\sim$} -70 K, which is compatible with known systematics in spectroscopy.},

The amplification reaches a factor of 3.5e {$\pm$}0 * 4 in the very brightest galaxies. The effect is dominated by spirals rather than ellipticals, so that the correlation function of bright spirals becomes comparable to that of normal ellipticals. Similar results are obtained whether the correlation function is measured in two or three dimensions. The effect persists to separations of a correlation length or more, and is not confined to the cores of the Virgo, Coma, and Abell 1367 clusters, suggesting that the effect is caused by biasing, that is, galaxies kindle preferentially in more clustered regions, rather than by gravitational relaxation.},

  abstract = {The massive photometric data collected from multiple large-scale sky surveys offer significant opportunities for measuring distances of celestial objects by photometric redshifts. However, catastrophic failure is still an unsolved problem for a long time and exists in the current photometric redshift estimation approaches (such as \$k\$-nearest-neighbor). In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage approach by integration of \$k\$-nearest-neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) methods together. In the first stage, we apply KNN algorithm on photometric data and estimate their corresponding z\$\_\{\textbackslash rm phot\}\$. By analysis, we find two dense regions with catastrophic failure, one in the range of z\$\_\{\textbackslash rm phot\}\textbackslash in[0.3,1.2]\$, the other in the range of z\$\_\{\textbackslash rm phot\}\textbackslash in [1.2,2.1]\$. In the second stage, we map the photometric input pattern of points falling into the two ranges from original attribute space into a high dimensional feature space by Gaussian kernel function in SVM. In the high dimensional feature space, many outlier points resulting from catastrophic failure by simple Euclidean distance computation in KNN can be identified by a classification hyperplane of SVM and further be corrected. Experimental results based on the SDSS (the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) quasar data show that the two-stage fusion approach can significantly mitigate catastrophic failure and improve the estimation accuracy of photometric redshifts of quasars. The percents in different |\$\textbackslash Delta\$z| ranges and rms (root mean square) error by the integrated method are \$83.47\textbackslash\%\$, \$89.83\textbackslash\%\$, \$90.90\textbackslash\%\$ and 0.192, respectively, compared to the results by KNN (\$71.96\textbackslash\%\$, \$83.78\textbackslash\%\$, \$89.73\textbackslash\%\$ and 0.204).},

  abstract = {We study the cross-correlation between the Planck CMB lensing convergence map and the eBOSS quasar overdensity obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV, in the redshift range \$0.9 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2\$. We detect the CMB lensing convergence-quasar cross power spectrum at \$5.4 \textbackslash sigma\$ significance. The cross power spectrum provides a quasar clustering bias measurement that is expected to be particularly robust against systematic effects. The redshift distribution of the quasar sample has a median redshift \$z \textbackslash approx 1.55\$, and an effective redshift about \$1.51\$. The best fit bias of the quasar sample is \$b\_q = 2.43 \textbackslash pm 0.45\$, corresponding to a host halo mass of \$\textbackslash log\_\{10\}\textbackslash left( \textbackslash frac\{M\}\{h\^\{-1\} M\_\textbackslash odot\} \textbackslash right) = 12.54\^\{+0.25\}\_\{-0.36\}\$. This is broadly consistent with the previous literature on quasars with a similar redshift range and selection. Since our constraint on the bias comes from the cross-correlation between quasars and CMB lensing, we expect it to be robust to a wide range of possible systematic effects that may contaminate the auto correlation of quasars. We checked for a number of systematic effects from both CMB lensing and quasar overdensity, and found that all systematics are consistent with null within \$2 \textbackslash sigma\$. The data is not sensitive to a possible scale dependence of the bias at present, but we expect that as the number of quasars increases (in future surveys such as DESI), it is likely that strong constraints on the scale dependence of the bias can be obtained.},

  abstract = {We present nbodykit, an open-source, massively parallel Python toolkit for analyzing large-scale structure (LSS) data. Using Python bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI), we provide parallel implementations of many commonly used algorithms in LSS. nbodykit is both an interactive and scalable piece of scientific software, performing well in a supercomputing environment while still taking advantage of the interactive tools provided by the Python ecosystem. Existing functionality includes estimators of the power spectrum, 2 and 3-point correlation functions, a Friends-of-Friends grouping algorithm, mock catalog creation via the halo occupation distribution technique, and approximate N-body simulations via the FastPM scheme. The package also provides a set of distributed data containers, insulated from the algorithms themselves, that enable nbodykit to provide a unified treatment of both simulation and observational data sets. nbodykit can be easily deployed in a high performance computing environment, overcoming some of the traditional difficulties of using Python on supercomputers. We provide performance benchmarks illustrating the scalability of the software. The modular, component-based approach of nbodykit allows researchers to easily build complex applications using its tools. The package is extensively documented at http://nbodykit.readthedocs.io, which also includes an interactive set of example recipes for new users to explore. As open-source software, we hope nbodykit provides a common framework for the community to use and develop in confronting the analysis challenges of future LSS surveys.},

We investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix. Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix is invertible. Methods. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data vectors. Results. We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the number of bins (data vector variables), p, to the number of data sets, n. This bias inevitably leads to an - in extreme cases catastrophic - underestimation of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is singular if p {$>$} n. \textcopyright{} ESO 2007.},

Galaxy clustering is measured with the two-point correlation function, which is calculated using a non-parametric kernel-based density estimator. We use our measurements to investigate the connection between the galaxies and the host dark matter halo using a halo occupation distribution methodology, deriving bias, satellite fractions, and typical host halo masses for stellar masses between 109.35 and 1010.85 M{$\odot$}, at redshifts 0.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.7. Our results show typical halo mass increasing with stellar mass (with moderate scatter) and bias increasing with stellar mass and redshift consistent with previous studies. We find that the satellite fraction increased towards low redshifts, from \textasciitilde 5 per cent at z \textasciitilde{} 1.5 to \textasciitilde 20 per cent at z \textasciitilde{} 0.6. We combine our results to derive the stellar mass-to-halo mass ratio for both satellites and centrals over a range of halo masses and find the peak corresponding to the halo mass with maximum star formation efficiency to be \textasciitilde 2 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$}, finding no evidence for evolution.},

  abstract = {Understanding the connections between galaxy stellar mass, star formation rate, and dark matter halo mass represents a key goal of the theory of galaxy formation. Cosmological simulations that include hydrodynamics, physical treatments of star formation, feedback from supernovae, and the radiative transfer of ionizing photons can capture the processes relevant for establishing these connections. The complexity of these physics can prove difficult to disentangle and obfuscate how mass-dependent trends in the galaxy population originate. Here, we train a machine learning method called Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) to infer how the stellar mass and star formation rate of nearly 6 million galaxies simulated by the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) project depend on the physical properties of halo mass, the peak circular velocity of the galaxy during its formation history \$v\_\textbackslash mathrm\{peak\}\$, cosmic environment, and redshift. The resulting EBM models reveal the relative importance of these properties in setting galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate, with \$v\_\textbackslash mathrm\{peak\}\$ providing the most dominant contribution. Environmental properties provide substantial improvements for modeling the stellar mass and star formation rate in only \$\textbackslash lesssim10\textbackslash\%\$ of the simulated galaxies. We also provide alternative formulations of EBM models that enable low-resolution simulations, which cannot track the interior structure of dark matter halos, to predict the stellar mass and star formation rate of galaxies computed by high-resolution simulations with detailed baryonic physics.},

The large size of the catalogue, which contains {$\sim$}220 000 redshifts, allows us to make high-precision measurements of various properties of the galaxy clustering pattern. The effective redshift at which our estimates are made is z s {$\approx$} 0.15, and similarly the effective luminosity, L s {$\approx$} 1.4L*. We estimate the redshift-space correlation function, {$\xi$}(s), from which we measure the redshift-space clustering length, S 0 = 6. 82 {$\pm$} 0.28 h -1 Mpc. We also estimate the projected correlation function, {$\Xi$} ({$\sigma$}), and the real-space correlation function, {$\xi$}(r), which can be fit by a power law (r/r 0) -{$\gamma$}r, with r 0 = 5.05 {$\pm$} 0.26 h -1 Mpc, {$\gamma$} r = 1.67 {$\pm$} 0.03. For r {$\greaterequivlnt$} 20 h -1 Mpc, {$\xi$} drops below a power law as, for instance, is expected in the popular A cold dark matter model. The ratio of amplitudes of the real- and redshift-space correlation functions on scales of 8-30 h -1 Mpc gives an estimate of the redshift-space distortion parameter {$\beta$}. The quadrupole moment of {$\xi$}({$\sigma$}, {$\pi$}) on scales 30-40 h -1 Mpc provides another estimate of {$\beta$}. We also estimate the distribution function of pairwise peculiar velocities, f(v), including rigorously the significant effect due to the infall velocities, and we find that the distribution is well fit by an exponential form. The accuracy of our {$\xi$}({$\sigma$}, {$\pi$}) measurement is sufficient to constrain a model, which simultaneously fits the shape and amplitude of {$\xi$}(r) and the two redshift-space distortion effects parametrized by {$\beta$} and velocity dispersion, a. We find {$\beta$}= 0.49 {$\pm$} 0.09 and a = 506 {$\pm$} 52 km s -1, although the best-fitting values are strongly correlated. We measure the variation of the peculiar velocity dispersion with projected separation, a({$\sigma$}), and find that the shape is consistent with models and simulations. This is the first time that {$\beta$} and f(v) have been estimated from a self-consistent model of galaxy velocities. Using the constraints on bias from recent estimates, and taking account of redshift evolution, we conclude that {$\beta$} (L = L*,z = 0) = 0.47 {$\pm$} 0.08, and that the present-day matter density of the Universe, {$\Omega$} m {$\approx$} 0.3, consistent with other 2dFGRS estimates and independent analyses.},

We apply a contrastive learning framework on multi-band galaxy photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to learn image representations. We then use them for galaxy morphology classification, and fine-tune them for photometric redshift estimation, using labels from the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset and SDSS spectroscopy. In both downstream tasks, using the same learned representations, we outperform the supervised state-of-the-art results, and we show that our approach can achieve the accuracy of supervised models while using 2-4 times fewer labels for training.},

Non-perturbative structure formed hierarchically over all scales, and developed non-Gaussian features in the Universe, known as the Cosmic Web (1). To fully understand the structure formation of the Universe is one of the holy grails of modern astrophysics. Astrophysicists survey large volumes of the Universe (2-9) and employ a large ensemble of computer simulations to compare with the observed data in order to extract the full information of our own Universe. However, to evolve trillions of galaxies over billions of years even with the simplest physics is a daunting task. We build a deep neural network, the Deep Density Displacement Model (here-after D 3 M), to predict the non-linear structure formation of the Universe from simple linear perturbation theory. Our extensive analysis, demonstrates that D 3 M outperforms the second order perturbation theory (hereafter 2LPT), the commonly used fast approximate simulation method, in point-wise comparison, 2-point correlation, and 3-point correlation. We also show that D 3 M is able to accurately extrapolate far beyond its training data, and predict structure formation for significantly different cosmological parameters. Our study proves, for the first time, that deep learning is a practical and accurate alternative to approximate simulations of the gravitational structure formation of the Universe. cosmology | deep learning | simulation | A t its core, modeling structure formation of the Universe is a computationally challenging task; it involves evolving trillions of particles with the correct physical model over a large volume over billions of years. To simplify this task, we either simulate a large volume with simpler physics or a smaller volume with more complex physics. In order to produce the cosmic web in large volume, we select gravity, the most important component of the theory, to simulate at large scales. A gravity-only N-body simulation is the most popular; and effective numerical method to predict the full 6D phase space distribution of a large number of massive particles whose positions and velocities evolve over time in the Universe (10). Nonetheless, N-body simulations are relatively computation-ally expensive, thus making the comparison of the N-body simulated large-scale structure (of different underlying cosmo-logical parameters) with the observed Universe a challenging task. Here, we propose to learn a deep model that predicts the structure formation as an alternative to expensive N-body simulations. Deep learning (11) is a fast growing branch of machine learning where recent advances have lead to models that reach and sometimes exceed human performance across diverse areas, from analysis and synthesis of images (12-14), sound (15, 16), text (17, 18) and videos (19, 20) to complex control and Fig. 1. (left) the displacement vector-field produced by D 3 M and; (right) the resulting density field. The vectors in the left figure are uniformly scaled down for better visualization. planning tasks as they appear in robotics and game-play (21-23). This new paradigm is also significantly impacting a variety of domains in the sciences, from biology (24, 25) to chemistry (26, 27) and physics (28, 29). In particular, in astronomy and cosmology, a growing number of recent studies are using deep learning for a variety of tasks, ranging from analysis of cosmic microwave background (30-32), large-scale structure (33, 34), and gravitational lensing effects (35, 36) to classification of different light sources (37-39). The ability of these models to learn complex functions has motivated many to use them to understand the physics of interacting objects leveraging image, video and relational data (40-50). However, modeling the dynamics of billions of particles in N-body simulations poses a distinct challenge. In this paper we show that a variation on the architecture of a well-known deep learning model (51), can efficiently transform the first order approximations to the displacement field and approximate the exact solution, thereby producing accurate estimates of the large-scale structure. Our objective is to show that this approach is a serious contender in replacing expensive cosmological simulations, and to this end we provide an extensive analysis of the results in the following section. The outcome of a typical N-body simulation depends on both the initial conditions and cosmological parameters. We report a rather surprising observation that our Deep Density Displacement Model (D 3 M), trained using a "single" set of S.He has led the project. S.He, Y.Li, Y.Feng and S.Ho performed the data analysis. Y.Feng provided all the simulations. W.Chen helped build the deep learning model. S.Ravanbakhsh, B.P\'oczos and W.Chen provided many deep learning suggestions. Y.Feng and S.Ho conceived the idea of using deep learning model to learn the structure formation of the universe. S.Ravanbakhsh, Y.Li, S.Ho and S.He contributed most to the manuscript writing. All authors commented on the manuscript.},

Halotools provides a modular platform for creating mock universes of galaxies starting from a catalog of dark matter halos obtained from a cosmological simulation. The package supports many of the common forms used to describe galaxy-halo models: the halo occupation distribution (HOD), the conditional luminosity function (CLF), abundance matching, and alternatives to these models that include effects such as environmental quenching or variable galaxy assembly bias. Satellite galaxies can be modeled to live in subhalos, or to follow custom number density profiles within their halos, including spatial and/or velocity bias with respect to the dark matter profile. The package has an optimized toolkit to make mock observations on a synthetic galaxy population, including galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy group identification, RSD multipoles, void statistics, pairwise velocities and others, allowing direct comparison to observations. Halotools is object-oriented, enabling complex models to be built from a set of simple, interchangeable components, including those of your own creation. Halotools has an automated testing suite and is exhaustively documented on http://halotools.readthedocs.io, which includes quickstart guides, source code notes and a large collection of tutorials.

  abstract = {The power spectrum of density fluctuations is a foundational source of cosmological information. Precision cosmological probes targeted primarily at investigations of dark energy require accurate theoretical determinations of the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime. To exploit the observational power of future cosmological surveys, accuracy demands on the theory are at the 1\% level or better. Numerical simulations are currently the only way to produce sufficiently error-controlled predictions for the power spectrum. The very high computational cost of (precision) N-body simulations is a major obstacle to obtaining predictions in the nonlinear regime, while scanning over cosmological parameters. Near-future observations, however, are likely to provide a meaningful constraint only on constant dark energy equation of state, "wCDM", cosmologies. In this paper, we demonstrate that a limited set of only 37 cosmological models - the "Coyote Universe" suite - can be used to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum to 1\% over a prior parameter range set by current cosmic microwave background observations. This paper is the second in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum for wCDM cosmologies. \textcopyright{} 2009 The American Astronomical Society.},

The star-galaxy separator is a statistical classification method which outputs class membership probabilities rather than class labels and allows the use of prior knowledge about the source populations. Deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data from the multiply imaged Stripe 82 region are used to check the results from our classifier, which compares favourably with the UKIDSS pipeline classification algorithm. The anomaly detection method addresses the problem posed by objects having different sets of recorded variables in cross-matched datasets. This prevents the use of methods unable to handle missing values and makes direct comparison between objects difficult. For each source, our method computes anomaly scores in subspaces of the observed feature space and combines them to an overall anomaly score. The proposed technique is very general and can easily be used in applications other than astronomy. The properties and performance of our method are investigated using both real and simulated datasets.},

Using the mock galaxy catalogue built by Smith et al. in the Millennium-XXL N-body simulation with a technique to assign galaxies to dark matter haloes based on halo occupation distribution modelling, we consider the clustering of galaxies selected by luminosity, colour and local density. We assess how well the BAO scale can be extracted by fitting a template to the power spectrum measured for each sample. We find that the BAO peak position is recovered equally well for samples defined by luminosity or colour, while there is a bias in the BAO scale recovered for samples defined by density. The BAO position is contracted to smaller scales for the densest galaxy quartile and expanded to large scales for the two least dense galaxy quartiles. For fixed galaxy number density, density-selected samples have higher uncertainties in the recovered BAO scale than luminosity-or colour-selected samples.},

In empirical tests the new method significantly improves calculation accuracy compared to standard nested sampling with the same number of samples; this increase in accuracy is equivalent to speeding up the computation by factors of up to {$\sim$} 72 for parameter estimation and {$\sim$} 7 for evidence calculations. We also show that the accuracy of both parameter estimation and evidence calculations can be improved simultaneously. In addition, unlike in standard nested sampling, more accurate results can be obtained by continuing the calculation for longer. Popular standard nested sampling implementations can be easily adapted to perform dynamic nested sampling, and several dynamic nested sampling software packages are now publicly available.},

To do this, we created a new, public, modular code Barry, which contains datasets, model fitting tools, and model implementations incorporating different descriptions of non-linear physics and algorithms for isolating the BAO feature. These are then evaluated for bias, correlation, and fitting strength using mock power spectra and correlation functions developed for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12. Our main findings are as follows: 1) All of the models can recover unbiased constraints when fit to the pre- and post-reconstruction simulations. 2) Models that provide physical descriptions of the damping of the BAO feature (using e.g., standard perturbation or effective-field theory arguments) report smaller errors on average, although the distribution of mock \$\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$ values indicates these are underestimated. 3) Allowing the BAO damping scale to vary can provide tighter constraints for some mocks, but is an artificial improvement that only arises when noise randomly sharpens the BAO peak. 4) Unlike recent claims in the literature when utilising a BAO Extractor technique, we find no improvement in the accuracy of the recovered BAO scale. 5) We implement a procedure for combining all models into a single consensus result that improves over the standard method without obviously underestimating the uncertainties. Overall, Barry provides an excellent framework for performing the cosmological analyses for upcoming surveys, and for rapidly testing and validating new models.},

Our main goal is to go beyond reporting detections towards developing a reliable likelihood analysis that allows one to determine cosmological constraints from ISW observations. With this in mind we spend a considerable amount of effort in determining the redshift-dependent bias and redshift distribution b(z)*dN/dz of these samples by matching with spectroscopic observations where available, and analyzing auto-power spectra and cross-power spectra between the samples. The data sets we use are 2-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) samples, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric Luminous Red Galaxies, SDSS photometric quasars and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio sources. We make a joint analysis of all samples constructing a full covariance matrix, which we subsequently use for cosmological parameter fitting. We report a 3.7 sigma detection of ISW combining all the datasets. We combine the ISW likelihood function with weak lensing of CMB and CMB power spectrum to constrain the equation of state of dark energy and the curvature of the Universe. While ISW does not significantly improve the constraints in the simplest 6-parameter flat Lambda CDM model, it improves constraints on 7-parameter models with curvature by a factor of 3.2 (relative to WMAP alone) to Omega\_K=-0.004\^\{+0.014\}\_\{-0.020\}, and with dark energy equation of state by 15\% to w=-1.01\^\{+0.30\}\_\{-0.40\}.

An elator allows estimation of silation output by interpolating across the parameter space of a limited number of silations. We present the first implementation in cosmology of ltifidelity elation, where many low-resolution silations are combined with a few high-resolution silations to achieve an increased elation accuracy. The power spectrum's dependence on cosmology is learned from the low-resolution silations, which are in turn calibrated using high-resolution silations. We show that our ltifidelity elator predicts high-fidelity (HF) counterparts to percent-level relative accuracy when using only three HF silations and outperfos a single-fidelity elator that uses 11 silations, although we do not attempt to produce a converged elator with high absolute accuracy. With a fixed number of HF training silations, we show that our ltifidelity elator is 100\texttimes{} better than a single-fidelity elator at \$k {$\leq$} 2, h \{Mpc\}\{\{-1\}\}\$, and 20\texttimes{} better at \$3 {$\leq$} klt 6.4, h \{Mpc\}\{\{-1\}\}\$. Multifidelity elation is fast to train, using only a simple modification to standard Gaussian processes. Our proposed elator shows a new way to predict non-linear scales by fusing silations from different fidelities.},

We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest.

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties , and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, n\textperiodcentered (Lpeak; z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so n\textperiodcentered (Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the ``break'' in the observed luminosity function. From n\textperiodcentered (Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, without invoking ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions.

  abstract = {We present an analysis of voids in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). This analysis includes identification of void regions and measurement of void statistics. The 2dFGRS is the largest completed redshift survey to date, including a total of 245,591 galaxies covering 1500 deg2 to a median depth of zmed\textasciitilde 0.11. We use the voidfinder algorithm to identify a total of 289 voids in the 2dFGRS with radius larger than 10 h-1 Mpc. These voids have an average effective radius, the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the void, of (14.89+/-2.65)h-1 Mpc in the North Galactic Pole region (NGP) and (15.61+/-2.84)h-1 Mpc in the South Galactic Pole region (SGP). These voids are extremely underdense, with average density contrast of {$\delta\rho$}/{$\rho$}=-0.94+/-0.02. The centers of voids are even emptier, because the few galaxies within the voids typically lie close to the edges. The total volume of the universe filled by these void regions is approximately 40\%. These results are very similar to results found from our analysis of the PSCz survey and the Updated Zwicky Catalog; here we detect almost a factor of 10 more voids. We measure the void probability function (VPF) of the 2dFGRS for volume-limited samples with limiting absolute magnitudes, Mlim-5logh, from -16 to -21 in bJ. We measure the underdensity probability function (with density contrast threshold {$\delta\rho$}/{$\rho$}=-0.8) for samples with limiting absolute magnitudes, Mlim-5logh, from -18 to -21. We find that the SGP is more underdense than the NGP for all but the brightest sample under consideration. There is good agreement between the VPFs of the Center for Astrophysics survey and the 2dFGRS. Comparison of VPFs measured for the 2dFGRS with the distribution of simulated dark matter halos of similar number density indicates that voids in the matter distribution in {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations are not empty enough. However, semianalytic models of galaxy formation that include feedback effects yield VPFs that show excellent agreement with the data.},

It is bordered by partial obscuration, which fades away into the regions of normal distribution where the frequency-curve of log Nm closely approximates a Gaussian error-curve. Systematic variations in longitude are appreciable only in the lower latitudes, where obscuration appears to be conspicuously greater in the direction of the galactic center than in the opposite direction.

  abstract = {The amount and complexity of data delivered by modern galaxy surveys has been steadily increasing over the past years. Extracting coherent scientific information from these large and multi-modal data sets remains an open issue and data driven approaches such as deep learning have rapidly emerged as a potentially powerful solution to some long lasting challenges. This enthusiasm is reflected in an unprecedented exponential growth of publications using neural networks. Half a decade after the first published work in astronomy mentioning deep learning, we believe it is timely to review what has been the real impact of this new technology in the field and its potential to solve key challenges raised by the size and complexity of the new datasets. In this review we first aim at summarizing the main applications of deep learning for galaxy surveys that have emerged so far. We then extract the major achievements and lessons learned and highlight key open questions and limitations. Overall, state-of-the art deep learning methods are rapidly adopted by the astronomical community, reflecting a democratization of these methods. We show that the majority of works using deep learning up to date are oriented to computer vision tasks. This is also the domain of application where deep learning has brought the most important breakthroughs so far. We report that the applications are becoming more diverse and deep learning is used for estimating galaxy properties, identifying outliers or constraining the cosmological model. Most of these works remain at the exploratory level. Some common challenges will most likely need to be addressed before moving to the next phase of deployment of deep learning in the processing of future surveys; e.g. uncertainty quantification, interpretability, data labeling and domain shift issues from training with simulations, which constitutes a common practice in astronomy.},

  abstract = {In this work, we assess the combined use of Gaia photometry and astrometry with infrared data from CatWISE in improving the identification of extragalactic sources compared to the classification obtained using Gaia data. Here we perform a comprehensive study in which we assess different input feature configurations and prior functions to identify extragalactic sources in Gaia, with the aim of presenting a classification methodology that integrates prior knowledge stemming from realistic class distributions in the Universe. In our work, we compare different classifiers, namely Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and the boosted decision trees, XGBoost and CatBoost, in a supervised approach, and classify sources into three classes, namely star, quasar, and galaxy, with the target quasar and galaxy class labels obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data release 16 (SDSS16) and the star label from Gaia EDR3. In our approach, we adjust the posterior probabilities to reflect the intrinsic distribution of extragalactic sources in the Universe via a prior function. In particular, we introduce two priors, a global prior reflecting the overall rarity of quasars and galaxies, and a mixed prior that incorporates in addition the distribution of the extragalactic sources as a function of Galactic latitude and magnitude. Our best classification performances, in terms of completeness and purity of the extragalactic classes, namely the galaxy and quasar classes, are achieved using the mixed prior for sources at high latitudes and in the magnitude range G = 18.5\textendash 19.5. We apply our identified best-performing classifier to three application datasets from Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3), and find that the global prior is more conservative in what it considers to be a quasar or a galaxy compared to the mixed prior. In particular, when applied to the quasar and galaxy candidate tables from GDR3, the classifier using a global prior achieves purities of 55\% for quasars and 93\% for galaxies, and purities of 59\% and 91\%, respectively, using the mixed prior. When compared to the performances obtained on the GDR3 pure quasar and galaxy candidate samples, we reach a higher level of purity, 97\% for quasars and 99.9\% for galaxies using the global prior, and purities of 96\% and 99\%, respectively, using the mixed prior. When refining the GDR3 candidate tables via a cross-match with SDSS DR16 confirmed quasars and galaxies, the classifier reaches purities of 99.8\% for quasars and 99.9\% for galaxies using a global prior, and 99.9\% and 99.9\% using the mixed prior. We conclude our work by discussing the importance of applying adjusted priors that portray realistic class distributions in the Universe and the effect of introducing infrared data as ancillary inputs in the identification of extragalactic sources.},

Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.},

Fluctuations in the CMB, baryons, cold dark matter (CDM), and neutrinos receive a boost at horizon crossing. Baryon drag on the photons causes alternating acoustic peak heights in the CMB and is uncovered in its bare form under the photon diffusion scale. Decoupling of the photons at last scattering and of the baryons at the end of the Compton drag epoch, freezes the diffusion-damped acoustic oscillations into the CMB and matter power spectra at different scales. We determine the dependence of the respective acoustic amplitudes and damping lengths on fundamental cosmological parameters. The baryonic oscillations, enhanced by the velocity overshoot effect, compete with CDM fluctuations in the present matter power spectrum. We present new exact analytic solutions for the cold dark matter fluctuations in the presence of a growth- inhibiting radiation \{\textbackslash it and\} baryon background. Combined with the acoustic contributions and baryonic infall into CDM potential wells, this provides a highly accurate analytic form of the small-scale transfer function in the general case.},

Using the CPI constructs, we classify important internal and external factors that influence how they identify, or not, as a physics person.

Our method follows an active learning strategy where the learning algorithm chooses objects which can potentially improve the learner if additional information about them is provided. This new information is subsequently used to update the machine learning model, allowing its accuracy to evolve with each new information. For the case of anomaly detection, the algorithm aims to maximize the number of scientifically interesting anomalies presented to the expert by slightly modifying the weights of a traditional Isolation Forest (IF) at each iteration. In order to demonstrate the potential of such techniques, we apply the Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) algorithm to 2 data sets: simulated light curves from the PLAsTiCC challenge and real light curves from the Open Supernova Catalog. We compare the AAD results to those of a static IF. For both methods, we performed a detailed analysis for all objects with the \textasciitilde 2\% highest anomaly scores. We show that, in the real data scenario, AAD was able to identify \textasciitilde 80\textbackslash\% more true anomalies than the IF. This result is the first evidence that AAD algorithms can play a central role in the search for new physics in the era of large scale sky surveys.},

The highest resolution simulation, Shin-Uchuu, consists of 262 billion (64003) particles in a box of side-length 140 h-1 Mpc, with particle mass of 8.97 \texttimes{} 105 h-1 M . Combining these simulations, we can follow the evolution of dark matter haloes and subhaloes spanning those hosting dwarf galaxies to massive galaxy clusters across an unprecedented volume. In this first paper, we present basic statistics, dark matter power spectra, and the halo and subhalo mass functions, which demonstrate the wide dynamic range and superb statistics of the Uchuu suite. From an analysis of the evolution of the power spectra, we conclude that our simulations remain accurate from the baryon acoustic oscillation scale down to the very small. We also provide parameters of a mass\textendash concentration model, which describes the evolution of halo concentration and reproduces our simulation data to within 5 per cent for haloes with masses spanning nearly eight orders of magnitude at redshift 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 14. There is an upturn in the mass\textendash concentration relation for the population of all haloes and of relaxed haloes at z 0.5, whereas no upturn is detected at z {$<$} 0.5. We make publicly available various N-body products as part of Uchuu Data Release 1 on the Skies \& Universes site.1 Future releases will include gravitational lensing maps and mock galaxy, X-ray cluster, and active galactic nucleus catalogues.},

The LSST design, with an 8.4m (6.7m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 sq. deg. field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera, will allow about 10,000 sq. deg. of sky to be covered twice per night, every three to four nights on average, with typical 5-sigma depth for point sources of r=24.5 (AB). With about 1000 observations in ugrizy bands over a 10-year period, these data will enable a deep stack reaching r=27.5 (about 5 magnitudes deeper than SDSS) and faint time-domain astronomy. The measured properties of newly discovered and known astrometric and photometric transients will be publicly reported within 60 sec after closing the shutter. In addition to a brief introduction to LSST, I review optical quasar selection techniques, with emphasis on methods based on colors, variability properties, and astrometric behavior.},

  abstract = {In order to prepare for the upcoming wide-field cosmological surveys, large simulations of the Universe with realistic galaxy populations are required. In particular, the tendency of galaxies to naturally align towards overdensities, an effect called intrinsic alignments (IA), can be a major source of systematics in the weak lensing analysis. As the details of galaxy formation and evolution relevant to IA cannot be simulated in practice on such volumes, we propose as an alternative a Deep Generative Model. This model is trained on the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation and is capable of sampling the orientations of a population of galaxies so as to recover the correct alignments. In our approach, we model the cosmic web as a set of graphs, where the graphs are constructed for each halo, and galaxy orientations as a signal on those graphs. The generative model is implemented on a Generative Adversarial Network architecture and uses specifically designed Graph-Convolutional Networks sensitive to the relative 3D positions of the vertices. Given (sub)halo masses and tidal fields, the model is able to learn and predict scalar features such as galaxy and dark matter subhalo shapes; and more importantly, vector features such as the 3D orientation of the major axis of the ellipsoid and the complex 2D ellipticities. For correlations of 3D orientations the model is in good quantitative agreement with the measured values from the simulation, except for at very small and transition scales. For correlations of 2D ellipticities, the model is in good quantitative agreement with the measured values from the simulation on all scales. Additionally, the model is able to capture the dependence of IA on mass, morphological type and central/satellite type.},

  abstract = {We build a field level emulator for cosmic structure formation that is accurate in the nonlinear regime. Our emulator consists of two convolutional neural networks trained to output the nonlinear displacements and velocities of N-body simulation particles based on their linear inputs. Cosmology dependence is encoded in the form of style parameters at each layer of the neural network, enabling the emulator to effectively interpolate the outcomes of structure formation between different flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmologies over a wide range of background matter densities. The neural network architecture makes the model differentiable by construction, providing a powerful tool for fast field level inference. We test the accuracy of our method by considering several summary statistics, including the density power spectrum with and without redshift space distortions, the displacement power spectrum, the momentum power spectrum, the density bispectrum, halo abundances, and halo profiles with and without redshift space distortions. We compare these statistics from our emulator with the full N-body results, the COLA method, and a fiducial neural network with no cosmological dependence. We find our emulator gives accurate results down to scales of \$k \textbackslash sim 1\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\textbackslash, h\$, representing a considerable improvement over both COLA and the fiducial neural network. We also demonstrate that our emulator generalizes well to initial conditions containing primordial non-Gaussianity, without the need for any additional style parameters or retraining.},

  abstract = {Future galaxy surveys will measure baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with high significance and a complete understanding of the anisotropies of BAOs in redshift space will be important to exploit the cosmological information in BAOs. Here we describe the anisotropies that arise in the redshift-space galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF) and elucidate the origin of features that arise in the dependence of BAOs on the angle between the orientation of the galaxy pair and the line of sight. We do so with a derivation of the configuration-space 2PCF using the streaming model. We find that, contrary to common belief, the locations of BAO peaks in the redshift-space 2PCF are anisotropic even in linear theory. Anisotropies in BAO depend strongly on the method of extracting the peak, showing a maximum of 3 per cent angular variation. We also find that extracting the BAO peak of the radius-square-weighted 2PCF, r2{$\xi$} (r, {$\mu$}), where {$\mu$} is the cosine between the line of sight and separation, reduces the anisotropy significantly to sub-per-cent level angular variations. When subtracting the tilt due to the broad-band behaviour of the 2PCF, the BAO bump is enhanced along the line of sight because of local infall velocities towards the BAO bump. Moving beyond the BAOs, precise measurement of the angular dependence of the redshift-space 2PCF on large scales, where linear theory models the anisotropies accurately, will allow new geometrical tests of dark energy.},

Although semi-analytic models (SAMs) and hydrodynamical simulations have made impressive advances in reproducing galaxy observables across large cosmological volumes, these methods still require significant computation times, representing a barrier to many applications. However, with Machine Learning, simulations and SAMs can now be emulated in seconds. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful class of learning algorithms which can naturally incorporate the very structure of data, and have been shown to perform extremely well on physical modeling, and among the most inherently graph-like structures found in astrophysics are the dark matter merger trees used by SAMs. In this paper we show that several baryonic targets\textemdash as predicted by a SAM\textemdash can be emulated to unprecedented accuracy using a trained GNN, four orders of magnitude faster than the SAM. The GNN accurately predicts stellar masses for a range of redshifts, and interpolates successfully at redshifts where it was not trained. We compare our results to the current state of the art in the field, and show improvements in mean-squared error of up to a factor of four.},

  abstract = {The similarity between the distributions of spins for galaxies (\$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm g\}\$) and for dark-matter haloes (\$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm h\}\$), indicated both by simulations and observations, is naively interpreted as a one-to-one correlation between the spins of a galaxy and its host halo. This is used to predict galaxy sizes in semi-analytic models via \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm e\}\textbackslash simeq\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm h\} R\_\{\textbackslash rm v\}\$, with \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm e\}\$ the half-mass radius of the galaxy and \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm v\}\$ the halo radius. Utilizing two different suites of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we find that \$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm g\}\$ and \$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm h\}\$ are in fact only barely correlated, especially at \$z\textbackslash geq 1\$. A general smearing of this correlation is expected based on the different spin histories, where the more recently accreted baryons through streams gain and then lose significant angular momentum compared to the gradually accumulated dark matter. Expecting the spins of baryons and dark matter to be correlated at accretion into \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm v\}\$, the null correlation at the end reflects an anti-correlation between \$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm g\}/\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm h\}\$ and \$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm h\}\$, which can partly arise from mergers and a compact star-forming phase that many galaxies undergo. On the other hand, the halo and galaxy spin vectors tend to be aligned, with a median \$\textbackslash cos\textbackslash theta=0.6\$-0.7 between galaxy and halo, consistent with instreaming within a preferred plane. The galaxy spin is better correlated with the spin of the inner halo, but this largely reflects the effect of the baryons on the halo. Following the null spin correlation, \$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm h\}\$ is not a useful proxy for \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm e\}\$. While our simulations reproduce a general relation of the sort \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm e\}=AR\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$, in agreement with observational estimates, the relation becomes tighter with \$A=0.02(c/10)\^\{-0.7\}\$, where \$c\$ is the halo concentration, which in turn introduces a dependence on mass and redshift.},

Exploring the distribution of quasars and stars in the colour spaces, we find that the combination of infrared and optical photometry is more conducive to select quasar candidates. Two new colour criterions (yW1W2 and iW1zW2) are constructed to distinguish quasars from stars efficiently. With iW1zW2, 98.30 per cent of star contamination is eliminated, while 99.50 per cent of quasars are retained, at least to the magnitude limit of our training set of stars. Based on the optical and infrared colour features, we put forward an efficient schema to select quasar candidates and high-redshift quasar candidates, in which two machine learning algorithms (XGBoost and SVM) are implemented. The XGBoost and SVM classifiers have proven to be very effective with accuracy of 99.46 per cent when 8Color as input pattern and default model parameters. Applying the two optimal classifiers to the unknown Pan-STARRS and AllWISE cross-matched data set, a total of 2 006 632 intersected sources are predicted to be quasar candidates given quasar probability larger than 0.5 (i.e. PQSO {$>$} 0.5). Among them, 1 201 211 have high probability (PQSO {$>$} 0.95). For these newly predicted quasar candidates, a regressor is constructed to estimate their redshifts. Finally 7402 z {$>$} 3.5 quasars are obtained. Given the magnitude limitation and site of the LAMOST telescope, part of these candidates will be used as the input catalogue of the LAMOST telescope for follow-up observation, and the rest may be observed by other telescopes.},

  abstract = {We present a pipeline to estimate baryonic properties of a galaxy inside a dark matter (DM) halo in DM-only simulations using a machine trained on high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. As an example, we use the ILLUSTRISTNG hydrodynamic simulation of a (75 h-1 Mpc)3 volume to train our machine to predict e.g. stellar mass and star formation rate in a galaxysized halo based purely on its DM content. An extremely randomized tree (ERT) algorithm is used together with multiple novel improvements we introduce here such as a refined error function in machine training and two-stage learning. Aided by these improvements, our model demonstrates a significantly increased accuracy in predicting baryonic properties compared to prior attempts \textendash{} in other words, the machine better mimics ILLUSTRISTNG's galaxy\textendash halo correlation. By applying our machine to the MULTIDARK-PLANCK DM-only simulation of a large (1 h-1 Gpc)3 volume, we then validate the pipeline that rapidly generates a galaxy catalogue from a DM halo catalogue using the correlations the machine found in ILLUSTRISTNG. We also compare our galaxy catalogue with the ones produced by popular semi-analytic models (SAMs). Our so-called machine-assisted semisimulation model (MSSM) is shown to be largely compatible with SAMs, and may become a promising method to transplant the baryon physics of galaxy-scale hydrodynamic calculations on to a larger volume DM-only run. We discuss the benefits that machine-based approaches like this entail, as well as suggestions to raise the scientific potential of such approaches.},

Given its dramatic influence on a galaxy's gas reservoir, gas accretion has to be largely responsible for how galaxies form and evolve. Therefore, given the importance of gas accretion, it is necessary to observe and quantify how these gas flows affect galaxy evolution. However, observational data have yet to conclusively show that gas accretion ubiquitously occurs at any epoch. Directly detecting gas accretion is a challenging endeavor and we now have obtained a significant amount of observational evidence to support it. This chapter reviews the current observational evidence of gas accretion onto star-forming galaxies.},

We use the influential Millennium Simulation and the corresponding Munich SAM to train and test various sophisticated machine learning algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, random forests and extremely randomized trees). By using only essential dark matter halo physical properties for haloes of \$M{$>$}10\^\{12\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and a partial merger tree, our model predicts the hot gas mass, cold gas mass, bulge mass, total stellar mass, black hole mass and cooling radius at z = 0 for each central galaxy in a dark matter halo for the Millennium run.

We generate new molecules with desired properties by sampling from the generative distribution estimated by the model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by evaluating it on drug-like molecules.

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-t ime domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-b ased regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-d imensional problems.},

Accurate theoretical predictions for these quantities are needed to maximize the scientific return of these programs. Simulating the Universe by including gravity and hydrodynamics is one of the most powerful techniques to accomplish this; unfortunately, these simulations are very expensive computationally. Alternatively, gravity-only simulations are cheaper, but do not predict the locations and properties of galaxies in the cosmic web. In this work, we use convolutional neural networks to paint galaxy stellar masses on top of the dark matter field generated by gravity-only simulations. Stellar mass of galaxies are important for galaxy selection in surveys and thus an important quantity that needs to be predicted.

Using mock catalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and larger scale signal are consistent with {$\Lambda$}CDM at the 1.5{$\sigma$} level. The signal at 155 {$<$} s {$<$} 200 h -1 Mpc tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; this slight deviation can be attributed to a bright subsample of the LRGs. Fitting data to a non-linear, redshift-space, template based-model, we constrain the peak position at s p = 103.6 +3.6 -2.4 h -1 Mpc when fitting the range 60 {$<$} s {$<$} 150 h -1 Mpc (1{$\sigma$} uncertainties measured from the mocks). This redshift-space distance s p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale r s after taking into account matter clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions and galaxy clustering bias.

  abstract = {We examine the correlation function {$\xi$} of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy sample at large scales (60 h -1 Mpc {$<$} s {$<$} 400 h -1 Mpc) using the final data release (DR7). Focusing on a quasi-volume-limited (0.16 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.36) subsample and utilizing mock galaxy catalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and larger scale signal are consistent with {$\Lambda$}CDM at 70\%-95\% confidence. Fitting data to a non-linear, redshift-space, template-based model, we constrain the peak position at s p = 101.7{$\pm$} 3.0 h -1 Mpc when fitting the range 60 h -1 Mpc {$<$} s {$<$} 150 h -1 Mpc (1{$\sigma$} uncertainties). This redshift-space distance s p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale rs after taking into account matter-clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions, and galaxy-clustering bias. Mock catalogs show that the probability that a DR7-sized sample would not have an identifiable peak is at least \textasciitilde 10\%. As a consistency check of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s p to obtain the distance D\_V{$\equiv$} ((1+z)\^2D\_A\^2cz/H(z))\^\{\{1\}/\{3\}\} relative to the acoustic scale. We find rs /DV (z = 0.278) = 0.1389 {$\pm$} 0.0043. This result is in excellent agreement with Percival et al., who examine roughly the same data set, but use the power spectrum. Comparison with other determinations in the literature are also in very good agreement. The signal of the full sample at 125 h -1 Mpc {$<$} s {$<$} 200 h -1 Mpc tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; this slight deviation can probably be attributed to sample variance.

Angle-averaged measurements of clustering yield constraints on the quantity However, to break the degeneracy between these two parameters one must measure the anisotropic clustering as a function of both line-of-sight (radial) and transverse separations. Here we investigate how to most effectively do so, using analytic techniques and mock catalogues. In particular, we examine multipole expansions of the correlation function and introduce 'clustering wedges'{$\xi$}({$\Delta\mu$}, s), where {$\mu$}=s {$\parallel$}/s and s {$\parallel$} is the radial component of separation s. Both techniques allow strong constraints on H and D A, as expected. The radial wedges strongly depend on H and the transverse wedges are sensitive to D A. When analysing the full shape of {$\xi$}, we find similar constraints when using the clustering wedges and the monopole-quadrupole pair. We find additional improvement when using the hexadecapole, as previously mentioned in the literature. Our findings here demonstrate that wedge statistics provide a practical alternative technique to multipoles, which should be useful to test systematics and will provide comparable constraints. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society \textcopyright{} 2011 RAS.},

  abstract = {The two-point correlation function of the galaxy distribution is a key cosmological observable that allows us to constrain the dynamical and geometrical state of our Universe. To measure the correlation function we need to know both the galaxy positions and the expected galaxy density field. The expected field is commonly specified using a Monte-Carlo sampling of the volume covered by the survey and, to minimize additional sampling errors, this random catalog has to be much larger than the data catalog. Correlation function estimators compare data-data pair counts to data-random and random-random pair counts, where random-random pairs usually dominate the computational cost. Future redshift surveys will deliver spectroscopic catalogs of tens of millions of galaxies. Given the large number of random objects required to guarantee sub-percent accuracy, it is of paramount importance to improve the efficiency of the algorithm without degrading its precision. We show both analytically and numerically that splitting the random catalog into a number of subcatalogs of the same size as the data catalog when calculating random-random pairs, and excluding pairs across different subcatalogs provides the optimal error at fixed computational cost. For a random catalog fifty times larger than the data catalog, this reduces the computation time by a factor of more than ten without affecting estimator variance or bias.},

We quantify the error of the pair-counts and of the Landy-Szalay estimator by comparing them with exact reference values. The standard method, using random point sets, is compared to geometrically motivated estimators and estimators using quasi-Monte\textasciitilde Carlo integration. In the standard method, the error scales proportionally to \$1/\textbackslash sqrt\{N\_r\}\$, with \$N\_r\$ being the number of random points. In our improved methods, the error scales almost proportionally to \$1/N\_q\$, where \$N\_q\$ is the number of points from a low-discrepancy sequence. We study the run times of the new estimator in comparison to those of the standard estimator, keeping the same level of accuracy. For the considered case, we always see a speedup ranging from 50\% up to a factor of several thousand. We also discuss how to apply these improved estimators to incompletely sampled galaxy catalogues.},

In this article well-known estimators for the correlation integral are reviewed and their relation to geometrical estimators for the two-point correlation function is put forward. Simulations illustrate the range of applicability of these estimators. The interpretation of the two-point correlation function as the excess of clustering with respect to Poisson distributed points has led to biases in common estimators. Comparing with the approximately unbiased geometrical estimators, we show how biases enter the estimators introduced by Davis and Peebles, Landy and Szalay, and Hamilton. We give recommendations for the application of the estimators, including details of the numerical implementation. The properties of the estimators of the correlation integral are illustrated in an application to a sample of IRAS galaxies. It is found that, due to the limitations of current galaxy catalogues in number and depth, no reliable determination of the correlation integral on large scales is possible. In the sample of IRAS galaxies considered, several estimators using different finite-size corrections yield different results on scales larger than 20 Mpc/h, while all of them agree on smaller scales.},

The estimators were ranked by the cumulative probability of returning a value within a certain tolerance of the real correlation function. This criterion takes into account bias and variance, and it is independent of the possibly non-Gaussian nature of the error statistics. As a result for astrophysical applications a clear recommendation has emerged: the Landy \& Szalay (1993) estimator, in its original or grid version Szapudi \& Szalay (1998), are preferred in comparison to the other indicators examined, with a performance almost indistinguishable from the Hamilton (1993) estimator.},

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

These distortions, if uncorrected for, lead to the retrieval of erroneous system parameters and may even lead to some planetary candidates being rejected as ostensibly unphysical. We provide analytic expressions for estimating the disturbance to the various light-curve parameters as a function of the integration time. These effects are particularly crucial in light of the long-cadence photometry often used for discovering new exoplanets by, for example, Convection Rotation and Planetary Transits (CoRoT) and the Kepler Missions (8.5 and 30 min). One of the dominant effects of long integration times is a systematic underestimation of the light-curve-derived stellar density, which has significant ramifications for transit surveys. We present a discussion of numerical integration techniques to compensate for the effects and produce expressions to quickly estimate the errors of such methods, as a function of integration time and numerical resolution. This allows for an economic choice of resolution before attempting fits of long-cadence light-curves. We provide a comparison of the short- and long-cadence light curves of TrES-2b and show that the retrieved transit parameters are consistent using the techniques discussed here. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Author.

The mocks have been calibrated using a reference galaxy catalogue based on the halo abundance matching modelling of the BOSS DR11 and DR12 galaxy clustering data and on the data themselves. The production follows three steps. First, we apply the PATCHY code to generate a dark matter field and an object distribution including non-linear stochastic galaxy bias. Secondly, we run the halo/stellar distribution reconstruction HADRON code to assign masses to the various objects. This step uses the mass distribution as a function of local density and non-local indicators (i.e. tidal field tensor eigenvalues and relative halo exclusion separation for massive objects) from the reference simulation applied to the corresponding patchy dark matter and galaxy distribution. Finally, we apply the SUGAR code to build the light cones. The resulting MultiDarkPATCHY mock light cones reproduce the number density, selection function, survey geometry, and in general within 1s, for arbitrary stellar mass bins, the power spectrum up to k = 0.3 h Mpc-1, the two-point correlation functions down to a few Mpc scales, and the three-point statistics of the BOSS DR11 and DR12 galaxy samples.},

  abstract = {Lambda Cold Dark Matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) is now the standard theory of structure formation in the universe. We present the first results from the new Bolshoi dissipationless cosmological {$\Lambda$}CDM simulation that uses cosmological parameters favored by current observations. The Bolshoi simulation was run in a volume 250 h -1Mpc on a side using 8 billion particles with mass and force resolution adequate to follow subhalos down to the completeness limit of V circ = 50kms-1 maximum circular velocity. Using merger trees derived from analysis of 180 stored time steps we find the circular velocities of satellites before they fall into their host halos. Using excellent statistics of halos and subhalos (10 million at every moment and 50 million over the whole history) we present accurate approximations for statistics such as the halo mass function, the concentrations for distinct halos and subhalos, the abundance of halos as a function of their circular velocity, and the abundance and the spatial distribution of subhalos. We find that at high redshifts the concentration falls to a minimum value of about 4.0 and then rises for higher values of halo mass - a new result. We present approximations for the velocity and mass functions of distinct halos as a function of redshift. We find that while the Sheth-Tormen (ST) approximation for the mass function of halos found by spherical overdensity is quite accurate at low redshifts, the ST formula overpredicts the abundance of halos by nearly an order of magnitude by z = 10. We find that the number of subhalos scales with the circular velocity of the host halo as V 1/2host, and that subhalos have nearly the same radial distribution as dark matter particles at radii 0.3-2 times the host halo virial radius. The subhalo velocity function N({$>$} V sub) scales as V -3circ. Combining the results of Bolshoi and Via Lactea-II simulations, we find that inside the virial radius of halos with the number of satellites is N({$>$} V sub) = (V sub/58 km s-1)-3 for satellite circular velocities in the range 4 km s-1 {$<$} V sub {$<$} 150 km s-1. \textcopyright{} 2011.

  abstract = {Large-scale surveys of galaxies require accurate theoretical predictions of the dark matter clustering for thousands of mock galaxy catalogues. We demonstrate that this goal can be achieved with the new Parallel Particle-Mesh (PM) N-body code GLAM at a very low computational cost. We run \textasciitilde 22 000 simulations with \textasciitilde 2 billion particles that provide \textasciitilde 1 per cent accuracy of the dark matter power spectra P(k) for wavenumbers up to k \textasciitilde{} 1 h Mpc-1. Using this large data set we study the power spectrum covariance matrix. In contrast to many previous analytical and numerical results, we find that the covariance matrix normalized to the power spectrum C(k, k')/P(k)P(k') has a complex structure of non-diagonal components: an upturn at small k, followed by a minimum at k {$\approx$} 0.1-0.2 h Mpc-1, and a maximum at k {$\approx$} 0.5-0.6 h Mpc-1. The normalized covariance matrix strongly evolves with redshift: C(k, k') {$\propto$} {$\delta\alpha$}(t)P(k)P(k'), where {$\delta$} is the linear growth factor and {$\alpha$} {$\approx$} 1-1.25, which indicates that the covariance matrix depends on cosmological parameters. We also show that waves longer than 1 h-1 Gpc have very little impact on the power spectrum and covariance matrix. This significantly reduces the computational costs and complexity of theoretical predictions: relatively small volume \textasciitilde (1 h-1 Gpc)3 simulations capture the necessary properties of dark matter clustering statistics. As our results also indicate, achieving \textasciitilde 1 per cent errors in the covariance matrix for k {$<$} 0.50 h Mpc-1 requires a resolution better than {$\epsilon$} \textasciitilde{} 0.5 h-1 Mpc.},

Such representations are often difficult to interpret or control. We consider the problem of unsupervised learning of features correlated to specific labels in a dataset. We propose a VAE-based generative model which we show is capable of extracting features correlated to binary labels in the data and structuring it in a latent subspace which is easy to interpret. Our model, the Conditional Subspace VAE (CSVAE), uses mutual information minimization to learn a low-dimensional latent subspace associated with each label that can easily be inspected and independently manipulated. We demonstrate the utility of the learned representations for attribute manipulation tasks on both the Toronto Face and CelebA datasets.},

To select Z/Z\_sun{$<$}0.1 EMPGs from \textasciitilde 40 million sources detected in the Subaru images, we first develop a machine-learning (ML) classifier based on a deep neural network algorithm with a training data set consisting of optical photometry of galaxy, star, and QSO models. We test our ML classifier with SDSS objects having spectroscopic metallicity measurements, and confirm that our ML classifier accomplishes 86\%-completeness and 46\%-purity EMPG classifications with photometric data. Applying our ML classifier to the photometric data of the Subaru sources as well as faint SDSS objects with no spectroscopic data, we obtain 27 and 86 EMPG candidates from the Subaru and SDSS photometric data, respectively. We conduct optical follow-up spectroscopy for 10 out of our EMPG candidates with Magellan/LDSS-3+MagE, Keck/DEIMOS, and Subaru/FOCAS, and find that the 10 EMPG candidates are star-forming galaxies at z=0.007-0.03 with large H\_beta equivalent widths of 104-265 A, stellar masses of log(M*/M\_sun)=5.0-7.1, and high specific star-formation rates of \textasciitilde 300 Gyr\^\{-1\}, which are similar to those of early galaxies at z{$>$}6 reported recently.

  abstract = {Large scale filaments, with lengths that can reach tens of Mpc, are the most prominent features in the cosmic web. These filaments have only been observed indirectly through the positions of galaxies in large galaxy surveys or through absorption features in the spectra of high redshift sources. In this study we propose to go one step further and directly detect intergalactic medium filaments through their emission in the HI 21cm line. We make use of high resolution cosmological simulations to estimate the intensity of this emission in low redshift filaments and use it to make predictions for the direct detectability of specific filaments previously inferred from galaxy surveys, in particular the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Given the expected signal of these filaments our study shows that HI emission from large filaments can be observed by current and next generation radio telescopes. We estimate that gas in filaments of length \$l \textbackslash gtrsim\$ 15 \$h\^\{-1\}\$Mpc with relatively small inclinations to the line of sight (\$\textbackslash lesssim 10\^\textbackslash circ\$) can be observed in \$\textbackslash sim40-100\$ hours with telescopes such as GMRT or EVLA, potentially providing large improvements over our knowledge of the astrophysical properties of these filaments. Due to their large field of view and sufficiently long integration times, upcoming HI surveys with the Apertif and ASKAP instruments will be able to detect large filaments independently of their orientation and curvature. Furthermore, our estimates indicate that a more powerful future radio telescope like SKA-2 can be used to map most of these filaments, which will allow them to be used as a strong cosmological probe.},

  abstract = {We review the observed demographics and inferred evolution of supermassive black holes (BHs) found by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass and the velocity dispersion of the host-galaxy bulge. It and other correlations led to the belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. BHs are found in pure-disk galaxies, so classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary to grow BHs. But BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. And any correlations with disk-grown pseudobulges or halo dark matter are so weak as to imply no close coevolution. We suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. 1- Local, stochastic feeding of small BHs in mainly bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. 2- Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers grows giant BHs in short, quasar-like "AGN" events whose feedback does affect galaxies. This makes classical bulges and coreless-rotating ellipticals. 3- At the highest BH masses, maintenance-mode feedback into X-ray gas has the negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating ellipticals. They inherit coevolution magic from smaller progenitors. 4- Independent of any feedback physics, the averaging that results from successive mergers helps to engineer tight BH correlations.},

  abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat \~ACDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the ``subhalos,'' distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, is similar to that found in semianalytic and N-body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, hN iM , has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for hN iM P 4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number Ns of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law hNsi / M   with   \% 1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0, the twopoint correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to \$100 h\`A1 kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z k 1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

Although HII region spectra serve as diagnostics to determine the present-day chemical composition of the interstellar medium, it is far from being understood to what extent the HII gas is already contaminated by chemically processed stellar wind. Therefore, we analyzed our models of radiative and wind bubbles of an isolated 85 M{$\cdot$} star with solar metallicity (Kr\"oger et al. 2006, A\&A, in preparation) with respect to the chemical enrichment of the circumstellar HII region. Plausibly, the hot stellar wind bubble (SWB) is enriched with 14N during the WN phase and even much higher with 12C and 16O during the WC phase of the star. During the short period that the 85 M{$\cdot$} star spends in the WC stage enriched SWB material mixes with warm HII gas of solar abundances and thus enhances the metallicity in the HII region. However, at the end of the stellar lifetime the mass ratios of the traced elements N and O in the warm ionized gas are insignificantly higher than solar, whereas an enrichment of 22\% above solar is found for C. Important issues from the presented study comprise a steeper radial gradient of C than O and a decreasing effect of self-enrichment for metal-poor galaxies. \textcopyright{} ESO 2006.},

For higher redshifts (z {$>$} 1.0), where galaxies are too faint, quasars still trace the large-scale structure of the Universe. Since available telescope time limits spectroscopic surveys, photometric methods are efficient for estimating redshifts for many quasars. Recently, machine learning methods are increasingly successful for quasar photometric redshifts, however, they hinge on the distribution of the training set. Therefore a rigorous estimation of reliability is critical. We extracted optical and infrared photometric data from the cross-matched catalogue of the WISE All-Sky and PS1 3\$\textbackslash pi\$ DR2 sky surveys. We trained an XGBoost regressor and an artificial neural network on the relation between color indices and spectroscopic redshift. We approximated the effective training set coverage with the K nearest neighbors algorithm. We estimated reliable photometric redshifts of 2,879,298 quasars which overlap with the training set in feature space. We validated the derived redshifts with an independent, clustering-based redshift estimation technique. The final catalog is publicly available.},

  abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) approach has proven to be an effective method for modeling galaxy clustering and bias. In this approach, galaxies of a given type are probabilistically assigned to individual halos in N-body simulations. In this paper, we present a fast emulator for predicting the fully nonlinear galaxy-galaxy auto and galaxy-dark matter cross power spectrum and correlation function over a range of freely specifiable HOD modeling parameters. The emulator is constructed using results from 100 HOD models run on a large {$\Lambda$}CDM N-body simulation, with Gaussian Process interpolation applied to a PCA-based representation of the galaxy power spectrum. The total error is currently {$\sim$}1\% in the auto correlations and {$\sim$}2\% in the cross correlations from z = 1 to z = 0, over the considered parameter range. We use the emulator to investigate the accuracy of various analytic prescriptions for the galaxy power spectrum, parametric dependencies in the HOD model, and the behavior of galaxy bias as a function of HOD parameters. Additionally, we obtain fully nonlinear predictions for tangential shear correlations induced by galaxy-galaxy lensing from our galaxy-dark matter cross power spectrum emulator.

We introduce the philosophy behind Shark and provide an overview of the physical processes included in the model. Shark is written in C++11 and has been parallelized with OpenMP. In the released version (v1.1), we implement several different models for gas cooling, active galactic nuclei, stellar and photo-ionization feedback, and star formation (SF). We demonstrate the basic performance of Shark using the Planck Collaboration et~al. (2016) cosmology SURFS simulations, by comparing against a large set of observations, including: the stellar mass function (SMF) and stellar\textendash halo mass relation at \$z\$ = 0\textendash 4; the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate density (SFRD), stellar mass, atomic and molecular hydrogen; local gas scaling relations; and structural galaxy properties, finding excellent agreement. Significant improvements over previous SAMs are seen in the mass\textendash size relation for discs/bulges, the gas\textendash stellar mass and stellar mass\textendash metallicity relations. To illustrate the power of Shark in exploring the systematic effects of the galaxy formation modelling, we quantify how the scatter of the SF main sequence and the gas scaling relations changes with the adopted SF law, and the effect of the starbursts H2 depletion time-scale on the SFRD and \$\textbackslash Omega \_\{\textbackslash rm H\_2\}\$. We compare Shark with other SAMs and the hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE, and find that SAMs have a much higher halo baryon fractions due to large amounts of intra-halo gas, which in the case of EAGLE is in the intergalactic medium.},

The primary mission was completed in 2010. The WISE team have done a superb job of producing a series of high-quality, well-documented, complete Data Releases in a timely manner. However, the "Atlas Image" coadds that are part of the recent AllWISE and previous data releases were intentionally blurred. Convolving the images by the point-spread function while coadding results in "matched-filtered" images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated point sources. But these matched-filtered images are sub-optimal or inappropriate for other purposes. For example, we are photometering the WISE images at the locations of sources detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York et al. 2000) through forward modeling, and this blurring decreases the available signal-to-noise by effectively broadening the point-spread function. This paper presents a new set of coadds of the WISE images that have not been blurred. These images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal-to-noise. Users should be cautioned, however, that the W3- and W4-band coadds contain artifacts around large, bright structures (large galaxies, dusty nebulae, etc); eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work. These new coadds, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me .},

We apply this framework to data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LOWZ sample cross-correlated with state-of-the-art gravitational lensing catalogues from the Kilo Degree Survey and the Dark Energy Survey. We show that gravitational lensing and redshift-space clustering when analysed over a large range of scales place tight constraints on the growth-of-structure parameter \$S\_8 = \textbackslash sigma\_8 \textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\} / 0.3\}\$. Overall, we infer \$S\_8 = 0.792 \textbackslash pm 0.022\$ when analysing the combination of galaxy-galaxy lensing and projected galaxy clustering and \$S\_8 = 0.771 \textbackslash pm 0.027\$ for galaxy redshift-space clustering. These findings highlight the potential constraining power of full-scale studies over studies analysing only large scales, and also showcase the benefits of analysing multiple large-scale structure surveys jointly. Our inferred values for \$S\_8\$ fall below the value inferred from the CMB, \$S\_8 = 0.834 \textbackslash pm 0.016\$. While this difference is not statistically significant by itself, our results mirror other findings in the literature whereby low-redshift large scale structure probes infer lower values for \$S\_8\$ than the CMB, the so-called \$S\_8\$-tension.},

Our full-scale analysis yields constraints on the growth of structure that are a factor of two more stringent than any other study on large scales at similar redshifts. We infer f8 = 0.471 {$\pm$} 0.024 at \$z\$ {$\approx$} 0.25, and f8 = 0.430 {$\pm$} 0.025 at \$z\$ {$\approx$} 0.40; the corresponding {$\Lambda$}CDM predictions of the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis are 0.470 {$\pm$} 0.006 and 0.476 {$\pm$} 0.005, respectively. Our results are thus consistent with Planck, but also follow the trend seen in previous low-redshift measurements of f8 falling slightly below the {$\Lambda$}CDM + CMB prediction. We find that small- and large-radial scales yield tually consistent values of f8, but there are 1-2.5 hints of small scales (\${$<$} 10h\{-1\}\{Mpc\}\$) preferring lower values for f8 relative to larger scales. We analyse the constraining power of the full range of radial scales, finding that most of the ltipole infoation about f8 is contained in the scales \$2h\{-1\}\{Mpc\}s 20h\{-1\}\{Mpc\}\$. Evidently, once the cosmological infoation of the quasi-to-nonlinear regime has been harvested, large-scale modes contain only modest additional infoation about structure growth. Finally, we compare predictions for the galaxy-galaxy lensing amplitude of the two samples against measurements from SDSS and assess the lensing-is-low effect in light of our findings.},

We find that halo ellipticity is strongly correlated with halo properties that serve as proxies of halo formation history, such as halo concentration and the normalized peak-centroid offset. These correlations are nearly independent of the halo density peak height. We present a simple model for the correlation between halo ellipticity and concentration using conditional abundance matching, and provide fitting formulae for the multidimensional distributions of triaxial halo shape as a function of halo peak height. We apply our halo shape model to gauge the effects of halo ellipticity and orientation bias on the excess surface mass density profiles in cluster-sized haloes. Our model should be useful for exploring the impact of triaxial halo shape on cosmological constraints in upcoming weak lensing surveys of galaxy clusters.},

In order to fully exploit the information available from this regime and to extract cosmological constraints, accurate theoretical predictions are needed. Currently, such predictions can only be obtained from costly, precision numerical simulations. This paper is the third in a series aimed at constructing an accurate calibration of the nonlinear mass power spectrum on Mpc scales for a wide range of currently viable cosmological models, including dark energy models with w = -1. The first two papers addressed the numerical challenges and the scheme by which an interpolator was built from a carefully chosen set of cosmological models. In this paper, we introduce the "Coyote Universe" simulation suite which comprises nearly 1000 N-body simulations at different force and mass resolutions, spanning 38 w CDM cosmologies. This large simulation suite enables us to construct a prediction scheme, or emulator, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum accurate at the percent level out to k 1 h Mpc -1. We describe the construction of the emulator, explain the tests performed to ensure its accuracy, and discuss how the central ideas may be extended to a wider range of cosmological models and applications.

We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogues trained to match observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and twodimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together with standard models of the galaxy-halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing signal that is 20-40 per cent larger than observed. Detailed tests show that our results are robust to a variety of systematic effects. Lowering the value of S8 = {$\sigma$}8 {$\surd$} {$\Omega$}m/0.3 compared to Planck Collaboration XIII reconciles the lensing with clustering. However, given the scale of our measurement (r {$<$} 10 h-1 Mpc), other effects may also be at play and need to be taken into consideration. We explore the impact of baryon physics, assembly bias, massive neutrinos and modifications to general relativity on {$\Delta\Sigma$} and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible given the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effect of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses. This is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection functions.},

In this work, we present a novel approach for parameterizing the degree of concentration dependence in the abundance matching method. This new parameterization provides a smooth interpolation between two commonly used matching proxies: the peak halo mass and the peak halo maximal circular velocity. This parameterization controls the amount of dependence of galaxy luminosity on halo concentration at a fixed halo mass. Effectively this interpolation scheme enables abundance matching models to have adjustable assembly bias in the resulting galaxy catalogs. With the new 400 Mpc h-1 DarkSky Simulation, whose larger volume provides lower sample variance, we further show that low-redshift two-point clustering and satellite fraction measurements from SDSS can already provide a joint constraint on this concentration dependence and the scatter within the abundance matching framework.},

These measurements rely on a quadratic maximum likelihood estimator that simultaneously measures the auto- and cross-power spectra of four redshift samples, and provides minimum-variance, unbiased estimates even at the largest angular scales. Since photometric quasars are known to be strongly affected by systematics such as spatially-varying depth and stellar contamination, we introduce a new framework of extended mode projection to robustly mitigate the impact of systematics on the power spectrum measurements. This technique involves constructing template maps of potential systematics, decorrelating them on the sky, and projecting out modes which are significantly correlated with the data. Our method is able to simultaneously process several thousands of nonlinearly-correlated systematics, and mode projection is performed in a blind fashion. Using our final power spectrum measurements, we find a good agreement with theoretical predictions, and no evidence for further contamination by systematics. Extended mode projection not only obviates the need for aggressive sky and quality cuts, but also provides control over the level of systematics in the measurements, enabling the search for small signals of new physics while avoiding confirmation bias.},

In this work, we investigate student attitudes towards STEM before and after taking a writing-intensive introductory astronomy course. We find that students cite writing about science as beneficial to their learning, deepening their understanding of science topics and their perspective on science as a field and finding writing to be a "bridge" between STEM content and their focus on humanities in their majors. Students also report increased perceptions of their own ability and confidence in engaging with STEM across multiple metrics, leaving the course more prepared to be informed, engaged, and science literate citizens.},

Many Monte Carlo methods produce correlated and/or weighted samples, for example produced by MCMC, nested, or importance sampling, and there can be hard boundary priors. GetDist's baseline method consists of applying a linear boundary kernel, and then using multiplicative bias correction. The smoothing bandwidth is selected automatically following Botev et al., based on a mixture of heuristics and optimization results using the expected scaling with an effective number of samples (defined to account for MCMC correlations and weights). Two-dimensional KDE use an automatically-determined elliptical Gaussian kernel for correlated distributions. The package includes tools for producing a variety of publication-quality figures using a simple named-parameter interface, as well as a graphical user interface that can be used for interactive exploration.

We find that f(R) gravity enhances the median value of the Bullock spin parameter, but could not detect such effects for DGP and coupled dark energy. f(R) also yields a lower median sphericity and oblateness, while coupled dark energy has the opposite effect. However, these effects are very small. We then study the interaction rate of haloes in different gravity and find that only strongly coupled dark energy models enhance the interaction rate. We then quantify the enhancement of the alignment of the spins of interacting halo pairs by modified gravity. Finally, we study the alignment of the major axes of haloes with the large-scale structures. The alignment of the spins of interacting pairs of haloes in DGP and coupled dark energy models show no discrepancy with GR, while f(R) shows a weaker alignment. Strongly coupled dark energy shows a stronger alignment of the halo shape with the largescale structures.},

Cosmological perturbation theory predicts that second-order density inhomogeneities are a convolution of a short- and a long-wavelength mode. This arises physically because small scale structures grow at different rates depending on the large scale environment in which they reside. This induces an off-diagonal term in the two-point statistics in Fourier space that we use as the basis for a quadratic estimator for the large scale field. We demonstrate that this quadratic estimator works well on an N-body simulation of size (2.5 h\^\{-1\} Gpc)\^3. In particular, the quadratic estimator successfully reconstructs the long-wavelength modes using only small-scale information. This opens up novel opportunities to study structure on the largest observable scales.},

Our measurements of wp(rp) as a function of the r-band luminosity are in excellent agreement with the previous two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and SDSS analyses. We compute wp(rp) as a function of stellar mass and we find that more-massive galaxies cluster more strongly than less-massive galaxies, with the difference increasing above the characteristic stellar mass M* of the Schechter mass function. We then divide our sample according to colour, 4000-\AA{} break strength, concentration and surface density. As expected, galaxies with redder colours, larger 4000-\AA{} break strengths, higher concentrations and larger surface mass densities cluster more strongly. The clustering differences are largest on small scales and for low-mass galaxies. At fixed stellar mass, the dependences of clustering on colour and 4000-\AA{} break strength are similar. Different results are obtained when galaxies are split by concentration or surface density. The dependence of wp(rp) on g - r and D4000 extends out to physical scales that are significantly larger than those of individual dark matter haloes ({$>$}5 h-1 Mpc). This large-scale clustering dependence is not seen for the parameters C or {$\mu$}* On small scales ({$<$} 1 h -l Mpc), the amplitude of the correlation function is constant for 'young' galaxies with 1.1 {$<$} D4000 1.5 and a steeply rising function of age for 'older' galaxies with D4000 1.5. In contrast, the dependence of the amplitude of wp(rp) on concentration on scales less than 1 h-1Mpc is strongest for disc-dominated galaxies with C {$<$} 2.6. This demonstrates that different proceses are required to explain environmental trends in the structure and in the star formation history of galaxies. \textcopyright{} 006 RAS.},

The apparent anisotropy in the distribution of observed galaxies arise from two main sources, the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect due to the galaxy peculiar velocities, and the geometric distortion when incorrect cosmological models are assumed for transforming redshift to comoving distance, known as the AP effect. Anisotropies produced by the RSD effect are, although large, maintaining a nearly uniform magnitude over a large range of redshift, while the degree of anisotropies from the AP effect varies with redshift by much larger magnitude. We split the DR12 galaxies into six redshift bins, measure the 2-point correlation function in each bin, and assess the redshift evolution of anisotropies. We obtain constraints of \$\textbackslash Omega\_m=0.290 \textbackslash pm 0.053,\textbackslash{} \textbackslash{} w = -1.07 \textbackslash pm 0.15\$, which are comparable with the current constraints from other cosmological probes such as type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO).

Conventional detection techniques are unable to deal with the increasingly dynamic and complex nature of the CPSs. On the other hand, the networked sensors and actuators generate large amounts of data streams that can be continuously monitored for intrusion events. Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be used to model the system behaviour and classify deviant behaviours as possible attacks. In this work, we proposed a novel Generative Adversarial Networks-based Anomaly Detection (GAN-AD) method for such complex networked CPSs. We used LSTM-RNN in our GAN to capture the distribution of the multivariate time series of the sensors and actuators under normal working conditions of a CPS. Instead of treating each sensor's and actuator's time series independently, we model the time series of multiple sensors and actuators in the CPS concurrently to take into account of potential latent interactions between them. To exploit both the generator and the discriminator of our GAN, we deployed the GAN-trained discriminator together with the residuals between generator-reconstructed data and the actual samples to detect possible anomalies in the complex CPS. We used our GAN-AD to distinguish abnormal attacked situations from normal working conditions for a complex six-stage Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. Experimental results showed that the proposed strategy is effective in identifying anomalies caused by various attacks with high detection rate and low false positive rate as compared to existing methods.},

The Einstein telescope is expected to produce 104-105 gravitational wave detections per year, 50-100 of which will be lensed. Here, we report a waveform-independent strategy to achieve precise cosmography by combining the accurately measured time delays from strongly lensed gravitational wave signals with the images and redshifts observed in the electromagnetic domain. We demonstrate that just 10 such systems can provide a Hubble constant uncertainty of 0.68\% for a flat lambda cold dark matter universe in the era of third-generation ground-based detectors.},

  abstract = {Clustering measurements of Gravitational Wave (GW) mergers in Luminosity Distance Space can be used in the future as a powerful tool for Cosmology. We consider tomographic measurements of the Angular Power Spectrum of mergers both in an Einstein Telescope-like detector network and in some more advanced scenarios (more sources, better distance measurements, better sky localization). We produce Fisher forecasts for both cosmological (matter and dark energy) and merger bias parameters. Our fiducial model for the number distribution and bias of GW events is based on results from hydrodynamical simulations. The cosmological parameter forecasts with Einstein Telescope are less powerful than those achievable in the near future via galaxy clustering observations with, e.g., Euclid. However, in the more advanced scenarios we see significant improvements. Moreover, we show that bias can be detected at high statistical significance. Regardless of the specific constraining power of different experiments, many aspects make this type of analysis interesting anyway. For example, compact binary mergers detected by Einstein Telescope will extend up to very high redshifts, particularly for binary black holes. Furthermore, Luminosity Distance Space Distortions in the GW analysis have a different structure with respect to Redshift-Space Distortions in galaxy catalogues. Finally, measurements of the bias of GW mergers can provide useful insight into their physical nature and properties.},

  abstract = {The current Hubble constant tension is usually presented by comparing constraints on \$H\_0\$ only. However, the post-recombination background cosmic evolution is determined by two parameters in the standard \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model, the Hubble constant (\$H\_0\$) and today's matter energy fraction (\$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm\{m\}\}\$). If we therefore compare all constraints individually in the \$H\_0\$-\$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm\{m\}\}\$ plane, (1) various constraints can be treated as independently as possible, (2) single-sided constraints are easier to consider, (3) compatibility among different constraints can be viewed in a more robust way, and (4) whether or not a nonstandard model is able to reconcile all constraints in tension can be seen more effectively. We perform a systematic comparison of independent constraints in the \$H\_0\$-\$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm\{m\}\}\$ space based on a flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Constraints along different degeneracy directions consistently overlap in one region of the space, with the exception of the local measurement from Cepheid variable-calibrated supernovae. Due to the different responses of individual constraints to a modified model, it is difficult for nonstandard models with modifications at high-, mid- or low-redshifts to reconcile all constraints if none of them have unaccounted-for systematic effects. Based on our analysis, the local measurement is the most outlying and therefore drives the bulk of the tension. This may suggest that the most likely solution to the tension is an alteration to the local result, either due to some previously unseen feature in our local cosmic environment, or some other unknown systematic effect.},

We focus here on the covariance matrices of anisotropic two-point correlation function measurements. Our comparison includes seven approximate methods, which can be divided into three categories: predictive methods that follow the evolution of the linear density field deterministically (ICE-COLA, Peak Patch, and Pinocchio), methods that require a calibration with N-body simulations (Patchy and Halogen), and simpler recipes based on assumptions regarding the shape of the probability distribution function (PDF) of density fluctuations (log-normal and Gaussian density fields). We analyse the impact of using covariance estimates obtained from these approximate methods on cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering measurements, using as a reference the covariances inferred from a set of full N-body simulations. We find that all approximate methods can accurately recover the mean parameter values in-2 M. Lippich et al. ferred using the N-body covariances. The obtained parameter uncertainties typically agree with the corresponding N-body results within 5\% for our lower mass threshold, and 10\% for our higher mass threshold. Furthermore, we find that the constraints for some methods can differ by up to 20\% depending on whether the halo samples used to define the covariance matrices are defined by matching the mass, number density, or clustering amplitude of the parent N-body samples. The results of our configuration-space analysis indicate that most approximate methods provide similar results, with no single method clearly outperforming the others.},

Properly mined, these enormous datasets will likely be wellsprings of rare or unknown astrophysical phenomena. The challenge is that the datasets are so large that most data will never be seen by human eyes; currently the most robust instrument we have to detect relevant anomalies. Machine learning is a useful tool for anomaly detection in this regime. However, it struggles to distinguish between interesting anomalies and irrelevant data such as instrumental artefacts or rare astronomical sources that are simply not of interest to a particular scientist. Active learning combines the flexibility and intuition of the human brain with the raw processing power of machine learning. By strategically choosing specific objects for expert labelling, it minimises the amount of data that scientists have to look through while maximising potential scientific return. Here we introduce Astronomaly: a general anomaly detection framework with a novel active learning approach designed to provide personalised recommendations. Astronomaly can operate on most types of astronomical data, including images, light curves and spectra. We use the Galaxy Zoo dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of Astronomaly, as well as simulated data to thoroughly test our new active learning approach. We find that for both datasets, Astronomaly roughly doubles the number of interesting anomalies found in the first 100 objects viewed by the user. Astronomaly is easily extendable to include new feature extraction techniques, anomaly detection algorithms and even different active learning approaches.

Nevertheless, only a mere fraction of the small planets detected by Kepler and K2 have precise mass measurements, which are mandatory to constrain their composition. We aim to characterise the planets that orbit the relatively bright star K2-138. This system is dynamically particular as it presents the longest chain known to date of planets close to the 3:2 resonance. We obtained 215 HARPS spectra from which we derived the radial-velocity variations of K2-138. Via a joint Bayesian analysis of both the K2 photometry and HARPS radial-velocities (RVs), we constrained the parameters of the six planets in orbit. The masses of the four inner planets, from b to e, are 3.1, 6.3, 7.9, and 13.0 M {$\oplus$} with a precision of 34\%, 20\%, 18\%, and 15\%, respectively. The bulk densities are 4.9, 2.8, 3.2, and 1.8 g cm -3 , ranging from Earth to Neptune-like values. For planets f and g, we report upper limits. Finally, we predict transit timing variations of the order two to six minutes from the masses derived. Given its peculiar dynamics, K2-138 is an ideal target for transit timing variation (TTV) measurements from space with the upcoming CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) to study this highly-packed system and compare TTV and RV masses.},

Numerous tests have been carried out on these ideas and, although the standard model works pretty well in fitting many observations, there are also many data that present apparent caveats to be understood with it.

We train Convolutional Neural Networks to learn the relationship between synthetic galaxy spectra and high resolution SFHs from the EAGLE and Illustris models. To evaluate our SFH reconstruction we use Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), which acts as a true percentage error in the low-error regime. On dust-attenuated spectra we achieve high test accuracy (median SMAPE = 12.0\%). Including the effects of simulated observational noise increases the error (13.2\%), however this is alleviated by including multiple realisations of the noise, which increases the training set size and reduces overfitting (11.4\%). We also make estimates for the observational and modelling errors. To further evaluate the generalisation properties we apply models trained on one simulation to spectra from the other, which leads to only a small increase in the error ({$\sim$} 16\%). We apply each trained model to SDSS DR7 spectra, and find smoother histories than in the VESPA catalogue. This new approach complements the results of existing SED fitting techniques, providing star formation histories directly motivated by the results of the latest cosmological simulations.},

However, much larger volumes are required to probe rare, overdense environments, and measure clustering statistics of the large scale structure. Typically, zoom simulations of individual regions are used to study rare environments, and semi-analytic models and halo occupation models applied to dark matter only (DMO) simulations are used to study the Universe in the large-volume regime. We propose a new approach, using a machine learning framework to explore the halo-galaxy relationship in the periodic EAGLE simulations, and zoom C-EAGLE simulations of galaxy clusters. We train a tree based machine learning method to predict the baryonic properties of galaxies based on their host dark matter halo properties. The trained model successfully reproduces a number of key distribution functions for an infinitesimal fraction of the computational cost of a full hydrodynamic simulation. By training on both periodic simulations as well as zooms of overdense environments, we learn the bias of galaxy evolution in differing environments. This allows us to apply the trained model to a larger DMO volume than would be possible if we only trained on a periodic simulation. We demonstrate this application using the \$(800 \textbackslash; \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\})\^3\$ P-Millennium simulation, and present predictions for key baryonic distribution functions and clustering statistics from the EAGLE model in this large volume.},

The comparisons reveal that in spite of the significantly different parameterizations for star formation and feedback processes, the three models yield qualitatively similar predictions for the assembly histories of galaxy stellar mass and star formation over cosmic time. We show that the SAMs generally require strong outflows to suppress star formation in low-mass halos to match the present day stellar mass function. However, all of the models considered produce predictions for the star formation rates and metallicities of low-mass galaxies that are inconsistent with existing data and diverge between the models. We suggest that large differences in the metallicity relations and small differences in the stellar mass assembly histories of model galaxies stem from different assumptions for the outflow mass-loading factor.

  abstract = {The mass distribution of dark matter haloes is the result of the hierarchical growth of initial density perturbations through mass accretion and mergers. We use an interpretable machine-learning framework to provide physical insights into the origin of the spherically-averaged mass profile of dark matter haloes. We train a gradient-boosted-trees algorithm to predict the final mass profiles of cluster-sized haloes, and measure the importance of the different inputs provided to the algorithm. We find two primary scales in the initial conditions (ICs) that impact the final mass profile: the density at approximately the scale of the haloes' Lagrangian patch \'i \textmu\'i{$\pm$} \'i \textmu\'i\textdegree\textquestiondown{} (\'i \textmu\'i{$\pm$} {$\sim$} 0.7 \'i \textmu\'i{$\pm$} \'i \textmu\'i\textdegree\textquestiondown ) and that in the large-scale environment (\'i \textmu\'i{$\pm$} {$\sim$} 1.7 \'i \textmu\'i{$\pm$} \'i \textmu\'i\textdegree\textquestiondown ). The model also identifies three primary timescales in the halo assembly history that affect the final profile: (i) the formation time of the virialized, collapsed material inside the halo, (ii) the dynamical time, which captures the dynamically unrelaxed, infalling component of the halo over its first orbit, (iii) a third, most recent timescale , which captures the impact on the outer profile of recent massive merger events. While the inner profile retains memory of the ICs, this information alone is insufficient to yield accurate predictions for the outer profile. As we add information about the haloes' mass accretion history, we find a significant improvement in the predicted profiles at all radii. Our machine-learning framework provides novel insights into the role of the ICs and the mass assembly history in determining the final mass profile of cluster-sized haloes.},

Our method ensures that an object with a specified astronomical color (e.g. g - r and r - i) has a unique color in the RGB image, as opposed to the burnt-out white stars to which we are accustomed. A natural consequence of this is that we can use the same colors to code color-magnitude diagrams, providing a natural 'index' to our images. We also introduce the use of an asinh stretch, which allows us to show faint objects while simultaneously preserving the structure of brighter objects in the field, such as the spiral arms of large galaxies. We believe that, in addition to their aesthetic value, our images convey far more information than do the traditional ones, and provide examples from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging, the Hubble Deep Field (HDF), and Chandra to support our claims.

The sample can be used to investigate the non-linear relation between the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray luminosity of quasars as well as to build a Hubble diagram up to a redshift of z {$\sim$} 7.5. We selected sources that are neither reddened by dust in the optical and UV nor obscured by gas in the X-rays, and whose X-ray fluxes are free from flux-limit-related biases. After checking for any possible systematics, we confirm, in agreement with our previous works, that the X-ray to UV relation provides distance estimates matching those from supernovae up to z {$\sim$} 1.5, and its slope shows no redshift evolution up to z {$\sim$} 5. We provide a full description of the methodology for testing cosmological models, further supporting a trend whereby the Hubble diagram of quasars is well reproduced by the standard flat cold dark matter model up to z {$\sim$} 1.5\textendash 2, but strong deviations emerge at higher redshifts. Since we have minimised all non-negligible systematic effects and proven the stability of the LX - LUV relation at high redshifts, we conclude that an evolution of the expansion rate of the Universe should be considered as a possible explanation for the observed deviation, rather than some systematic (redshift-dependent) effect associated with high-redshift quasars.},

We perform an independent analysis of theCFHTLenS six bin tomography results of Heymans et al. We extend their systematics treatment and find the cosmological constraints to be relatively robust to the choice of non-linear modelling, extension to the intrinsic alignment model and inclusion of baryons. We find that when marginalized in the {$\Omega$}m-{$\sigma$}8 plane, the 95 per cent confidence contours of CFHTLenS and Planck+WMAP only just touch, but the discrepancy is less significant in the full six-dimensional parameter space of {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM). Allowing a massive active neutrino or tensor modes does not significantly resolve the tension in the full n-dimensional parameter space. Our results differ from some in the literature because we use the full tomographic information in the weak lensing data and marginalize over systematics. We note that adding a sterile neutrino to {$\Lambda$}CDM brings the 2D marginalized contours into greater overlap, mainly due to the extra effective number of neutrino species, which we find to be 0.88 {$\pm$} 0.43 (68 per cent) greater than standard on combining the data sets. We discuss why this is not a completely satisfactory resolution, leaving open the possibility of other new physics or observational systematics as contributing factors. We provide updated cosmology fitting functions for the CFHTLenS constraints and discuss the differences from ones used in the literature.},

To do so, we explore cosmological inference using mock dark matter halo catalogues. We employ Information Maximising Neural Networks (IMNNs) to quantify Fisher information extraction as a function of graph representation. We a) demonstrate the high sensitivity of modular graph structure to the underlying cosmology in the noise-free limit, b) show that networks automatically combine mass and clustering information through comparisons to traditional statistics, c) demonstrate that graph neural networks can still extract information when catalogues are subject to noisy survey cuts, and d) illustrate how nonlinear IMNN summaries can be used as asymptotically optimal compressed statistics for Bayesian implicit likelihood inference. We reduce the area of joint \$\textbackslash Omega\_m, \textbackslash sigma\_8\$ parameter constraints with small (\$\textbackslash sim\$100 object) halo catalogues by a factor of 42 over the two-point correlation function, and demonstrate that the networks automatically combine mass and clustering information. This work utilises a new IMNN implementation over graph data in Jax, which can take advantage of either numerical or auto-differentiability. We also show that graph IMNNs successfully compress simulations far from the fiducial model at which the network is fitted, indicating a promising alternative to \$n\$-point statistics in catalogue-based analyses.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the cross-correlation coefficient between galaxies and dark matter is very close to unity on scales outside a few virial radii of galaxy haloes, independent of the details of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes. This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter clustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on large-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 7.We generalize the approach of Baldauf et al. to remove small-scale information (below 2 and 4 h-1 Mpc for lensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlation coefficient differs from unity.We derive constraints for three galaxy samples covering 7131 deg2, containing 69 150, 62 150 and 35 088 galaxies with mean redshifts of 0.11, 0.28 and 0.40. We clearly detect scale-dependent galaxy bias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent with theoretical expectations.When we vary both s8 and {$\Omega$}m (and marginalize over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat {$\lambda$} cold dark matter model, the bestconstrained quantity is s8({$\Omega$}m/0.25)0.57 = 0.80 {$\pm$} 0.05 (1{$\sigma$}, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors (photometric redshift and shear calibration) have comparable contributions, and we have fixed ns = 0.96 and h = 0.7. These strong constraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method is competitive with cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in some ways less serious systematics. We therefore expect that this method will play a prominent role in future weak lensing surveys. When we combine these data with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-year (WMAP7) cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, constraints on {$\sigma$}8, {$\Omega$}m, H0, wde and {$\sum$}mv become 30-80 per cent tighter than with CMB data alone, since our data break several parameter degeneracies. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

The catalog covers an area of 136.9 deg 2 split into six fields, with a mean i-band seeing of 0.58 {${'}{'}$} and 5{$\sigma$} point-source depth of i {$\sim$} 26. Given conservative galaxy selection criteria for first year science, the depth and excellent image quality results in unweighted and weighted source number densities of 24.6 and 21.8 arcmin -2 , respectively. We define the requirements for cosmological weak lensing science with this catalog, then focus on characterizing potential systematics in the catalog using a series of internal null tests for problems with point-spread function (PSF) modeling, shear estimation, and other aspects of the image processing. We find that the PSF models narrowly meet requirements for weak lens-ing science with this catalog, with fractional PSF model size residuals of approximately 0.003 (requirement: 0.004) and the PSF model shape correlation function {$\rho$} 1 {$<$} 3 \texttimes{} 10 -7 (requirement: 4 \texttimes{} 10 -7) at 0.5 \textbullet{} scales.

Although black holes have been known to populate the centers of at least a few dwarf galaxies, and indirect evidence of AGN quenching of star formation in dwarfs has begun to surface, our measurements constitute the first direct detection and measurement of AGN impact on the large scale kinematics and gas content in dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we find evidence suggestive of ongoing star formation suppression, possibly regulated by the AGN. Galaxy formation models must therefore be able to account not only for the formation and growth of black holes at the centers of dwarf galaxies, but should also be revised to include AGN as important -- and perhaps dominant -- sources of feedback in low mass galaxies},

  abstract = {Secondary halo bias, commonly known as `assembly bias', is the dependence of halo clustering on a halo property other than mass. This prediction of the {$\Lambda$} Cold Dark Matter cosmology is essential to modelling the galaxy distribution to high precision and interpreting clustering measurements. As the name suggests, different manifestations of secondary halo bias have been thought to originate from halo assembly histories. We show conclusively that this is incorrect for cluster-size haloes. We present an up-to-date summary of secondary halo biases of high-mass haloes due to various halo properties including concentration, spin, several proxies of assembly history, and subhalo properties. While concentration, spin, and the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloes exhibit significant secondary biases, properties that directly quantify halo assembly history do not. In fact, the entire assembly histories of haloes in pairs are nearly identical to those of isolated haloes. In general, a global correlation between two halo properties does not predict whether or not these two properties exhibit similar secondary biases. For example, assembly history and concentration (or subhalo abundance) are correlated for both paired and isolated haloes, but follow slightly different conditional distributions in these two cases. This results in a secondary halo bias due to concentration (or subhalo abundance), despite the lack of assembly bias in the strict sense for cluster-size haloes. Due to this complexity, caution must be exercised in using any one halo property as a proxy to study the secondary bias due to another property.},

  abstract = {With the advent of future big-data surveys, automated tools for unsupervised discovery are becoming ever more necessary. In this work, we explore the ability of deep generative networks for detecting outliers in astronomical imaging datasets. The main advantage of such generative models is that they are able to learn complex representations directly from the pixel space. Therefore, these methods enable us to look for subtle morphological deviations which are typically missed by more traditional moment-based approaches. We use a generative model to learn a representation of expected data defined by the training set and then look for deviations from the learned representation by looking for the best reconstruction of a given object. In this first proof-of-concept work, we apply our method to two different test cases. We first show that from a set of simulated galaxies, we are able to detect \$\textbackslash sim 90\textbackslash\%\$ of merging galaxies if we train our network only with a sample of isolated ones. We then explore how the presented approach can be used to compare observations and hydrodynamic simulations by identifying observed galaxies not well represented in the models.

  abstract = {We introduce the IllustrisTNG project, a new suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO employing an updated Illustris galaxy formation model. Here we focus on the general properties of magnetic fields and the diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters. Magnetic fields are prevalent in galaxies, and their build-up is closely linked to structure formation. We find that structure formation amplifies the initial seed fields (10-14 comoving Gauss) to the values observed in low-redshift galaxies (1-10 \{{$\mu$} G\}). The magnetic field topology is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields are hosted by early-type galaxies, while large-scale, ordered fields are present in disc galaxies. Using two simple models for the energy distribution of relativistic electrons we predict the diffuse radio emission of 280 clusters with a baryonic mass resolution of 1.1\texttimes{} 107 \{M\_\{{$\odot\rbrace\rbrace$}, and generate mock observations for Very Large Array (VLA), Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our simulated clusters show extended radio emission, whose detectability correlates with their virial mass. We reproduce the observed scaling relations between total radio power and X-ray emission, M500, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Y500 parameter. The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different instruments. Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations, but a refined analysis requires a more sophisticated treatment of relativistic particles in large-scale galaxy formation simulations.\vphantom{\}\}}},

  abstract = {Accurate planning of forthcoming missions requires an accurate knowledge of diffuse sources in order to optimize mission parameters and the scanning strategy to meet the expected performances. Zodiacal Light (ZL or Zody) is a well known contaminant for ground based and space-borne observations in the optical and infrared bands, and recent results from the Planck collaboration highlights its importance for high sensitivity observations in the millimetre domain [1]. In visible and near IR it determines the limit magnitude which can be reached by a survey so that proper modelling of ZL is needed for survey planning. Despite the physics of ZL emission is well known, dominated by scattering of Sun light from Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDPs) for wavelengths shorter than 3.5-\textmu m, and their thermal emission for larger wavelengths, predicting and modelling of Zody is complicated by a number of subtleties [2]. The cloud of IDPs has a quite complex 3D structure, whose main geometrical parameters have been assessed in the last two decades, but their photometrical properties are affected by a significant level of uncertainty. In optical, current measures of the exact level of ZL contamination are affected by light from background stars. In sub-mm the worst uncertainty is the model of dust grains emissivity. The observer orbiting the Sun is moving within the cloud of IDPs, leading to an important time dependence in the perturbing signal and asking for a precise knowledge of the expected trajectory and scanning strategy of the mission. This poster illustrates this problem taking the ESA Euclid mission as a case study. The Euclid Mission Euclid is an European Space Agency (ESA) mission aimed to understand the nature of the dark Universe. Observations conducted on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation proved the existence in our Universe of two dominant components whose nature is entirely unknown [3]: Dark Matter (26.8 \%) and Dark Energy (68.3 \%). To enlight the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, Euclid will investigate the distance-redshift relationship and the evolution of cosmic structures by means of two instruments: VIS: high quality images to carry out the weak lensing galaxy shear measurements; NISP: redshift measurements for a wide sample of galaxies. Zodiacal Light Contamination ZL is the combination of scattered solar light and thermal emission due to IDPs forming a system of clouds approximately aligned with the ecliptic plane. The optical depth of the IDPs cloud is {$\approx$} 10 -7 , so that the amount of light received is the line integral of the radiation scattered or emitted along the whole line of sight toward which the telescope is pointed P [2] I ZL (P, t) = +{$\infty$} 0 dL c N ZL,c (R E (t) + L P)F ZL,c (R E (t) + L P) (1) with L is the distance from the observer, R E the position of the observer, F ZL,c the production of ZL in a given solar system location, N ZL,c the density of IDPs in that location, c denotes the IDPs subcloud contributing to ZL. See left frame of Fig. 1 for a snap shot of the geometry. Since the observer is orbiting the Sun, R E will be a function of the observing time t, and I ZL will be a function of time too. For a periodic orbit ZL will present an important seasonal variability as shown in Fig. 1 at right. Figure 1: Left geometry of line integral Eq. 1. Right time dependence of ZL near the ecliptic for a telescope orbiting the Sun and kept at fixed Solar Aspect Angle (SAA) from it. Typical SAA for Euclid are in the range 85 \textbullet{} - 110 \textbullet{} Survey Optimization and ZEUS In Euclid, as well as in many other surveys, operations are planned and optimized using one or more Survey Optimization Codes (SOCs). SOCs, which are based on static maps and catalogues, can hardly handle the inherent ZL time variability. Usually ZL contamination is accounted for in SOCs by including some routine based on some static approximation. The problem is: how to include a time dependent foreground in a code designed assuming static ones? The most obvious solution would be to distribute a whole 3D model of the IDPs cloud to the teams in charge of developing the SOCs. But there is not a unique 3D model for ZL and until the end of the mission, there will be not a unique orbit file, in addition the same sequence of observations can be iterated many times during the optimization process, and the integration of Eq. 1 would lead to an slowing of the SOCs. The ZEUS project (Zody EUclid Simulator) has the scope to decouple the ZL model from the optimization code. ZEUS is written in Python and needs the pyfits and healpy libraries. The Optimization Code produces a possible survey, i.e. a list of couples (t, P). ZEUS computes the ZL contamination starting from a set of precomputed tables, which are representative of a particular combination of ZL model, M ZL , and expected Euclid orbit O EU. ZEUS ZL compression To compress the information produced by complex 3D models ZEUS exploits the periodicity of ZL signal. Using a 3D model of choice, as an example [2], a set of full sky map representing ZL contamination can be produced at discrete time intervals over a discrete set of pointing directions, P i , corresponding to the map pixels i. Three of those maps are presented in Fig. 2. ZL is computed using the widely used 3D model from COBE [2]. To represent the sky, ZEUS uses the HEALpix pixelization scheme [4], which has the advantage of allowing equiareal pixelization, a simple spatial interpolation and has a stable support library for Python and C/C++. Figure 2: Full sky daily maps of ZL in ecliptic coordinates for Euclid mission at day 0, 87 and 175 of year. The gray spot is a region of the map too near the Sun. The 3D model is [2], and Euclid is assumed to be in the Earth-Sun L2 point, units are log 10 (MJy/sr), wavelength is 1.25 \textmu m, ecliptic longitude 0 is at the map center. At first ZEUS assumes an Ecliptic Corotating Reference Frame, whose longitudes originate from the Sun at the epoch of observation, {$\lambda$} , instead of {$\gamma$}. In this reference frame any pointing direction has a fixed height above the ecliptic and a fixed SAA. Further data compression is provided by expanding in Fourier series the time dependence of I ZL for each corotating pixel i in the corotating map: I zody,i (t) = \textasciimacron{} I zody,i + N ft k=1 C z,i,k cos 2{$\pi$}kt T o + N ft k=1 S z,i,k sin 2{$\pi$}kt T o (2) where T o is the length of the mission, \textasciimacron{} I zody,i is the yearly averaged zody emission, C z,i,k and S z,i,k are the Fourier cosine and sine coefficients of order k. Therefore, a data set for ZEUS provided for a given combination (O EU , M ZL) is a set of 2N ft + 1 HEALpix maps. Typically N ft = 8 and maps with resolution parameter N side = 128, so that each data set needs few tens of megabytes. Fig. 3 shows a map of the \textasciimacron{} I zody and the power of the first two coefficients for a typical ZEUS data set. \textasciimacron{} I zody k = 1 k = 2-1 1.7 log10(MJy/sr)-5.77877 1.18568 log10(MJy/sr)-8.41211-1.15145 log10(MJy/sr) Figure 3: Power (C 2 z,i,k + S 2 z,i,k) of ZL Fourier transform. Euclid is assumed in L2 and ZL model is [2]. ZEUS Usage At startup the SOCs using Zeus must load the appropriated ZEUS data set for the given ZL model and orbit. After that they have to provide to ZEUS the list of (t, P) for which to compute I ZL , ZEUS uses t to derive the instantaneous {$\lambda$} and rotates P in the corotating reference frame. From t ZEUS derives a set of HEALpix corotating maps using Eq. 2 from which the corresponding I ZL are interpolation over the map. In Euclid a large number of observations are framed in time intervals so short that ZL can be considered a time constant. A single ZL corotating map can be used for many simulated observations compensating the computational cost for its derivation. Results The ZEUS package allows the integration of time dependent contamination from Zodiacal Light inside Euclid survey optimization codes which are designed for a static sky model. It decouples the complexity of Zodiacal Light 3D models from the that of the survey optimization. Compared to the use of a static ZL model the increase in coding complexity is quite modest. At the opposite of 3D models, ZEUS allows scalability easy parallelization. The relative accuracy of ZEUS compared to a full 3D model is of the order of some 10 -4 , two or three orders of magnitude below the intrinsic uncertainties in the models. The gain in speed with respect to a full 3D model is about two order of magnitudes.

  abstract = {Our understanding of the Universe has progressed through deliberate, targeted studies of known phenomena, like the supernova campaigns that enabled the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, as much as through serendipitous, unexpected discoveries. The discovery of the Jovian moons, and of interstellar objects like 1I/'Oumuamua forced us to rethink the framework through which we explain the Universe and develop new theories. Recent surveys, like the Catalina Realtime-Transient Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility, and upcoming ones, like the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, explore the parameter space of astrophysical transients at all time scales, from hours to years, and offer the opportunity to discover new, unexpected phenomena. In this paper, we investigate strategies to identify novel objects and to contextualize them within large time-series data sets to facilitate the discovery of new objects, new classes of objects, and the physical interpretation of their anomalous nature. We compare tree-based and manifold-learning algorithms for anomaly detection as they are applied to a data set of light curves from the Kepler observatory that include the bona fide anomalous Boyajian's star. We assess the impact of pre-processing and feature engineering schemes and investigate the astrophysical nature of the objects that our models identify as anomalous by augmenting the Kepler data with \textbackslash emph\{Gaia\} color and luminosity information. We find that multiple models, used in combination, are a promising strategy to not only identify novel time series but also to find objects that share phenomenological and astrophysical characteristics with them, facilitating the interpretation of their anomalous characteristics.},

We apply this statistic to several stochastic point fields, to three numerical simulations describing the distribution of clusters and finally to real galaxy redshift surveys. Four different galaxy catalogues have been analysed using this technique: the Center for Astrophysics I, the Perseus--Pisces redshift surveys (these two lying in our local neighbourhood), the Stromlo--APM and the 1.2 Jy \{\textbackslash it IRAS\} redshift surveys (these two encompassing a larger volume). In all cases, this cumulant quantity shows the fingerprint of the transition to homogeneity. The reliability of the estimates is clearly demonstrated by the results from controllable point sets, such as the segment Cox processes. In the cluster distribution models, as well as in the real galaxy catalogues, we never see long plateaus when plotting \$D\_2\$ as a function of the scale, leaving no hope for unbounded fractal distributions.},

The marked power spectrum can be used to emphasize low density regions over high density regions, and therefore is potentially much more sensitive than the power spectrum to the effects of neutrino masses. Using 22,000 N-body simulations from the Quijote suite, we quantify the information content in the marked power spectrum of the matter field, and show that it outperforms the standard power spectrum by setting constraints improved by a factor larger than 2 on all cosmological parameters. The combination of marked and standard power spectrum allows to place a 4.3{$\sigma$} constraint on the minimum sum of the neutrino masses with a volume equal to 1 (Gpc h -1) 3 and without CMB priors.

We consider two representative models for the mass spectrum, namely a power-law model between two hard cut-offs at a minimum and maximum mass, and a similar model combined with a Gaussian peak. Both models exhibit characteristic scales that allow an indirect estimate of the source redshift. In the case of the LIGO-Virgo detector network with current and future sensitivities we perform the analysis of an extensive set of simulated data using a hierarchical Bayesian scheme that jointly fit the source population and cosmological parameter. We also re-analyse the LIGO-Virgo O2 data. Those analyses all evidence the tight interplay between source population and cosmological parameters and the influence of initial assumptions formulated on the ones or the others. We find that: \$(i)\$ the upper mass cut-off and the position of the Gaussian peak display the largest correlation with the cosmological parameters; \$(ii)\$ incorrect population models may bias the Hubble constant estimate by 40\%, or incorrect value for \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{m,0\}\$ may lead a significant bias on \$H\_0\$; \$(iii)\$ the estimates enter the large sample regime with asymptotic normality and \$1/\textbackslash sqrt\{N\}\$ error decay from \$N\textbackslash sim200\$ GW events. Overall, our results suggest that the inference on source population and cosmological parameters should be addressed \textbackslash textit\{jointly\} and not separately as it is in most studies so far.},

  abstract = {We use the hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation to study the magnitude and origin of the scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation for central galaxies. We separate cause and effect by correlating stellar masses in the baryonic simulation with halo properties in a matched dark matter only (DMO) simulation. The scatter in stellar mass increases with redshift and decreases with halo mass. At z = 0.1, it declines from 0.25 dex at M200, DMO {$\approx$} 1011 M{$\odot$} to 0.12 dex at M200, DMO {$\approx$} 1013 M{$\odot$}, but the trend is weak above 1012 M{$\odot$}. For M200, DMO {$<$} 1012.5 M{$\odot$} up to 0.04 dex of the scatter is due to scatter in the halo concentration. At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass corresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher concentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion and star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with higher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, Vmax, DMO, and binding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass, meaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide fitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass. However, concentration alone cannot explain the total scatter in the M\_star - M\_\{200, DMO\} relation, and it does not explain the scatter in Mstar-Vmax, DMO. Halo spin, sphericity, triaxiality, substructure and environment are also not responsible for the remaining scatter, which thus could be due to more complex halo properties or non-linear/stochastic baryonic effects.},

Higher order statistics, such as the 3PCF, are necessary to probe the non-Gaussian structure and shape information expected in these distributions. We measure the clustering of spectroscopic galaxies in the Main Galaxy Sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), focusing on the shape or configuration dependence of the reduced 3PCF in both redshift and projected space. This work constitutes the largest number of galaxies ever used to investigate the reduced 3PCF, using over 220,000 galaxies in three volume-limited samples. We find significant configuration dependence of the reduced 3PCF at 3-27 Mpc/h, in agreement with LCDM predictions and in disagreement with the hierarchical ansatz. Below 6 Mpc/h, the redshift space reduced 3PCF shows a smaller amplitude and weak configuration dependence in comparison with projected measurements suggesting that redshift distortions, and not galaxy bias, can make the reduced 3PCF appear consistent with the hierarchical ansatz. The reduced 3PCF shows a weaker dependence on luminosity than the 2PCF, with no significant dependence on scales above 9 Mpc/h. On scales less than 9 Mpc/h, the reduced 3PCF appears more affected by galaxy color than luminosty. We demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the 3PCF to systematic effects such as sky completeness and binning scheme, along with the difficulty of resolving the errors. Some comparable analyses make assumptions that do not consistently account for these effects.},

  abstract = {The large-scale redshift-space distortion (RSD) in galaxy clustering can probe f {$\sigma$} 8 , a combination of cosmic structure growth rate and matter fluctuation amplitude, which can constrain dark energy models and test theories of gravity. While the RSD on small scales (e.g. a few to tens of h -1 Mpc) can further tighten the f {$\sigma$} 8 constraints, galaxy assembly bias, if not correctly modeled, may introduce systematic uncertainties. Using a mock galaxy catalogue with built-in assembly bias, we perform a preliminary study on how assembly bias may affect the f {$\sigma$} 8 inference. We find good agreement on scales down to 8-9 h -1 Mpc between a f {$\sigma$} 8 metric from the redshift-space two-point correlation function with the central-only mock catalogue and that with the shuffled catalogue free of assembly bias, implying that f {$\sigma$} 8 information can be extracted on such scales even with assembly bias. We then apply the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and three subhalo clustering and abundance matching (SCAM) models to model the redshift-space clustering with the mock. Only the SCAM model based on V peak (used to create the mock) can reproduce the f {$\sigma$} 8 metric, and the other three could not. However, the f {$\sigma$} 8 metrics determined from central galaxies from all the models are able to match the expected one down to 8 h -1 Mpc. Our results suggest that halo models with no or an incorrect assembly bias prescription could still be used to model the RSD down to scales of {$\sim$} 8 h -1 Mpc to tighten the f {$\sigma$} 8 constraint, with a sample of central galaxies or with a flexible satellite occupation prescription.},

Our emulator is constructed from the AEMULUS simulations, a suite of 40 N-body simulations with snapshots from z=3 to z=0. These simulations cover the flat wCDM parameter space allowed by recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae results, varying the parameters w, Omega\_m, Omega\_b, sigma\_8, N\_\{eff\}, n\_s, and H\_0. We validate our emulator using five realizations of seven different cosmologies, for a total of 35 test simulations. These test simulations were not used in constructing the emulator, and were run with fully independent initial conditions. We use our test simulations to characterize the modeling uncertainty of the emulator, and introduce a novel way of marginalizing over the associated systematic uncertainty. We confirm non-universality in our halo mass function emulator as a function of both cosmological parameters and redshift. Our emulator achieves better than 1\% precision over much of the relevant parameter space, and we demonstrate that the systematic uncertainty in our emulator will remain a negligible source of error for cluster abundance studies through at least the LSST Year 1 data set.},

  abstract = {Models of the spatial distribution of dark matter halos must achieve new levels of precision and accuracy in order to satisfy the requirements of upcoming experiments. In this work, we present a halo bias emulator for modeling the clustering of halos on large scales. It incorporates the cosmological dependence of the bias beyond the mapping of halo mass to peak height. The emulator makes substantial improvements in accuracy compared to the widely used Tinker et al. (2010) model. Halos in this work are defined using an overdensity criteria of 200 relative to the mean background density. Halo catalogs are produced for 40 N-body simulations as part of the Aemulus project at snapshots from z=3 to z=0. The emulator is trained over the mass range \$6\textbackslash times10\^\{12\}-7\textbackslash times10\^\{15\}\textbackslash{} h\^\{-1\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Using an additional suite of 35 simulations, we determine that the precision of the emulator is redshift dependent, achieving sub-percent levels for a majority of the redshift range. Two additional simulation suites are used to test the ability of the emulator to extrapolate to higher and lower masses. Our high-resolution simulation suite is used to develop an extrapolation scheme in which the emulator asymptotes to the Tinker et al. (2010) model at low mass, achieving \textasciitilde 3\% accuracy down to \$10\^\{11\}\textbackslash{} h\^\{-1\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Finally, we present a method to propagate emulator modeling uncertainty into an error budget.

From a Magellan-Clay spectrum we secure the galaxy redshift at z = 0.624. We find a strong X-ray source coincident with the spheroid galaxy. Spectral features and a high X-ray luminosity indicate the presence of an AGN in the galaxy. However, a comparison of the X-ray luminosity to a sample derived from the Chandra Deep Field South displays L X to be comparable to Type I/QSO galaxies while the optical flux is consistent with a normal star-forming galaxy. We conclude that the galaxy's non-thermal component dominates at high-energy wavelengths while we associate the spheroid blue light with the stellar spectrum of normal star-forming galaxies. We argue about a probable association between the presence of blue cores in spheroids and AGN activity.},

While the existence of this cross-correlation has firmly been established, existing data did not allow an accurate measurement of wQG yet, but wide area surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey now provide an ideal database for measuring it. However, wQG depends on several cosmological parameters and the galaxy bias factor. We study in detail the sensitivity of wQG to these parameters and develop a strategy for using the data. We show that the parameter space can be reduced to the bias factor \textasciimacron b, {$\Omega$}0 and {$\sigma$}8, and compute the accuracy with which these parameters can be deduced from SDSS data. Under reasonable assumptions, it should be possible to reach relative accuracies of the order of 5\%\textendash 15\% for \textasciimacron b, {$\Omega$}0, and {$\sigma$}8.

However, a single-value summary fails to capture the complexity of MAHs and information can be lost in the process. We present MultiCAM, a generalization of traditional abundance matching frameworks, which can simultaneously connect the full MAH of a halo with multiple halo and/or galaxy properties. As a first case study, we apply MultiCAM to the problem of connecting dark matter halo properties to their MAHs in the context of a dark matter-only simulation. While some halo properties, such as concentration, are more strongly correlated to the early-time mass growth of a halo, others, like the virial ratio, have stronger correlations with late-time mass growth. This highlights the necessity of considering the impact of the entire MAH on halo properties. For most of the halo properties we consider, we find that MultiCAM models that use the full MAH achieve higher accuracy than conditional abundance matching models which use a single epoch. We also demonstrate an extension of MultiCAM that captures the covariance between predicted halo properties. This extension provides a baseline model for applications where the covariance between predicted properties is important.},

The Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is an 870 megapixel prime focus optical imaging camera for the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. The wide-field corrector delivers sharp images of 0.2 (FWHM) in the HSC-i band over the entire 1.5 diameter field of view. The collimation of the camera with respect to the optical axis of the primary mirror is done with hexapod actuators, the mechanical accuracy of which is a few microns. Analysis of the remaining wavefront error in off-focus stellar images reveals that the collimation of the optical componentsmeets design specifications.While there is a flexure of mechanical components, it also is within the design specification. As a result, the camera achieves its seeing-limited imaging on Maunakea during most of the time; the median seeing over several years of observing is 0.67 (FWHM) in the i band. The sensors use p-channel, fully depleted CCDs of 200{$\mu$}m thickness (2048 \texttimes{} 4176 15{$\mu$}m square pixels) and we employ 116 of them to pave the 50 cm diameter focal plane. The minimum interval between exposures is 34 s, including the time to read out arrays, to transfer data to the control computer, and to save them to the hard drive. HSC on Subaru uniquely features a combination of a large aperture, a wide field of view, sharp images and a high sensitivity especially at longer wavelengths, which makes the HSC one of the most powerful observing facilities in the world.},

  abstract = {From 1,000 hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project, each with a different value of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters, we generate 15,000 gas temperature maps. We use a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network to recover missing data from those maps. We mimic the missing data by applying regular and irregular binary masks that cover either 15\% or 30\% of the area of each map. We quantify the reliability of our results using two summary statistics: 1) the distance between the probability density functions (pdf), estimated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, and 2) the 2D power spectrum. We find an excellent agreement between the model prediction and the unmasked maps when using the power spectrum: better than 1\% for k {$<$} 20 h/Mpc for any irregular mask. For regular masks, we observe a systematic offset of {$\sim$} 5\% when covering 15\% of the maps while the results become unreliable when 30\% of the data is missing. The observed KS-test p-values favor the null hypothesis that the reconstructed and the ground-truth maps are drawn from the same underlying distribution when irregular masks are used. For regular-shaped masks on the other hand, we find a strong evidence that the two distributions do not match each other. Finally, we use the model, trained on gas temperature maps, to perform inpainting on maps from completely different fields such as gas mass, gas pressure, and electron density and also for gas temperature maps from simulations run with other codes. We find that visually, our model is able to reconstruct the missing pixels from the maps of those fields with great accuracy, although its performance using summary statistics depends strongly on the considered field.},

By studying their star-formation histories, we find two main evolutionary paths converging into the same quiescent galaxy population at z {$\sim$} 0.55. Fast-growing LRGs assemble 80\% of their stellar mass very early on (z {$\sim$} 5), whereas slow-growing LRGs reach the same evolutionary state at z {$\sim$} 1.5. Further investigation reveals that their clustering properties on scales of {$\sim$}1\textendash 30 Mpc are, at a high level of significance, also different. Fast-growing LRGs are found to be more strongly clustered and reside in overall denser large-scale structure environments than slow-growing systems, for a given stellar-mass threshold. Our results imply a dependence of clustering on stellar-mass assembly history (naturally connected to the mass-formation history of the corresponding halos) for a homogeneous population of similar mass and color, which constitutes a strong observational evidence of galaxy assembly bias.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local, stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph-and 3D shape analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.},

  abstract = {As of this moment, fifty gravitational waves (GW) detections have been announced, thanks to the observational efforts of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, working with the Advanced LIGO and the Advanced Virgo interferometers. The detection of signals is complicated by the noise-dominated nature of the data. Conventional approaches in GW detection procedures require either precise knowledge of the GW waveform in the context of matched filtering searches or coincident analysis of data from multiple detectors. Furthermore, the analysis is prone to contamination by instrumental or environmental artifacts called glitches which either mimic astrophysical signals or reduce the overall quality of data. In this paper, we propose an alternative generic method of studying GW data based on detecting anomalies. The anomalies we study are transient signals, different from the slow non-stationary noise of the detector. Presented in the manuscript anomalies are mostly based on the GW emitted by the mergers of binary black hole systems. However, the presented study of anomalies is not limited only to GW alone, but also includes glitches occurring in the real LIGO/Virgo dataset available at the Gravitational Waves Open Science Center.},

  abstract = {Conservation of the phase-space density of photons plus Lorentz invariance requires that the cosmological luminosity distance be larger than the angular diameter distance by a factor of (1 + z)2, where z is the redshift. Because this is a fundamental symmetry, this prediction - known sometimes as the "Etherington relation" or the "Tolman test" - is independent of the world model, or even the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy. It depends, however, on Lorentz invariance and transparency. Transparency can be affected by intergalactic dust or interactions between photons and the dark sector. Baryon acoustic feature (BAF) and type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) measures of the expansion history are differently sensitive to the angular diameter and luminosity distances and can therefore be used in conjunction to limit cosmic transparency. At the present day, the comparison only limits the change {$\Delta\tau$} in the optical depth from redshift 0.20 to 0.35 at visible wavelengths to {$\Delta\tau$} {$<$} 0.13 at 95\% confidence. In a model with a constant comoving number density n of scatterers of constant proper cross section {$\sigma$}, this limit implies n{$\sigma$} {$<$} 2 \texttimes{} 10 -4 h Mpc-1. These limits depend weakly on the cosmological world model. Assuming a concordance world model, the best-fit value of {$\Delta\tau$} to current data is negative at the 2{$\sigma$} level. This could signal interesting new physics or could be the result of unidentified systematics in the BAF/SNeIa measurements. Within the next few years, the limits on transparency could extend to redshifts z 2.5 and improve to n{$\sigma$} {$<$} 1.1 \texttimes{} 10-5 h Mpc-1. Cosmic variance will eventually limit the sensitivity of any test using the BAF at the n{$\sigma$} {$\sim$} 4 \texttimes{} 10-7 h Mpc-1 level. Comparison with other measures of the transparency is provided; no other measure in the visible is as free of astrophysical assumptions. \textcopyright{} 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

  abstract = {High redshift quasars (HZQs) with redshifts of z {$>\sptilde$} 6 are so rare that any photometrically-selected sample of sources with HZQ-like colours is likely to be dominated by Galactic stars and brown dwarfs scattered from the stellar locus. It is impractical to reobserve all such candidates, so an alternative approach was developed in which Bayesian model comparison techniques are used to calculate the probability that a candidate is a HZQ, P\_q, by combining models of the quasar and star populations with the photometric measurements of the object. This method was motivated specifically by the large number of HZQ candidates identified by cross-matching the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS) to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS): in the \textasciitilde 1900 deg\^2 covered by the LAS in the UKIDSS Seventh Data Release (DR7) there are \textasciitilde 10\^3 real astronomical point-sources with the measured colours of the target quasars, of which only \textasciitilde 10 are expected to be HZQs. Applying Bayesian model comparison to the sample reveals that most sources with HZQ-like colours have P\_q {$<\sptilde$} 0.1 and can be confidently rejected without the need for any further observations. In the case of the UKIDSS DR7 LAS, there were just 88 candidates with P\_q {$>$}= 0.1; these object were prioritized for reobservation by ranking according to P\_q (and their likely redshift, which was also inferred from the photometric data). Most candidates were rejected after one or two (moderate depth) photometric measurements by recalculating P\_q using the new data. That left seven confirmed HZQs, three of which were previously identified in the SDSS and four of which were new UKIDSS discoveries. The high efficiency of this Bayesian selection method suggests that it could usefully be extended to other HZQ surveys (e.g. searches by Pan-STARRS or VISTA) as well as to other searches for rare objects.},

This situation is especially acute with the Kepler survey, which has found over 2300 candidates but has confirmed only 77 planets to date. I present here a general procedure that can quickly be applied to any planet candidate to calculate its false positive probability. This procedure takes into account the period, depth, duration, and shape of the signal; the colors of the target star; arbitrary spectroscopic or imaging follow-up observations; and informed assumptions about the populations and distributions of field stars and multiple-star properties. Applying these methods to a sample of known Kepler planets, I demonstrate that many signals can be validated with very limited follow-up observations: in most cases with only a spectrum and an AO image. Additionally, I demonstrate that this procedure can reliably identify false positive signals. Because of the computational efficiency of this analysis, it is feasible to apply it to all Kepler planet candidates in the near future, and it will streamline the follow-up efforts for Kepler and other current and future transit surveys.},

Since Kepler has detected many more planetary signals than can be positively confirmed with ground-based follow-up efforts in the near term, these calculations will be crucial to using the ensemble of Kepler data to determine population characteristics of planetary systems.

The most important halo properties to predict stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) are halo mass, growth rate, and scale factor at the time the mass peaks, which results from a feature importance analysis with random forests. We train different models with supervised learning to find the optimal network architecture. GalaxyNet is then trained with a reinforcement learning approach: for a fixed set of weights and biases, we compute the galaxy properties for all haloes and then derive mock statistics (stellar mass functions, cosmic and specific SFRs, quenched fractions, and clustering). Comparing these statistics to observations we get the model loss, which is minimized with particle swarm optimization. GalaxyNet reproduces the observed data very accurately and predicts a stellar-to-halo mass relation with a lower normalization and shallower low-mass slope at high redshift than empirical models. We find that at low mass, the galaxies with the highest SFRs are satellites, although most satellites are quenched. The normalization of the instantaneous conversion efficiency increases with redshift, but stays constant above z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.5. Finally, we use GalaxyNet to populate a cosmic volume of (5.9~Gpc)3 with galaxies and predict the BAO signal, the bias, and the clustering of active and passive galaxies up to z~= 4, which can be tested with next-generation surveys, such as LSST and Euclid.},

  abstract = {Evidences for late-time acceleration of the Universe are provided by multiple probes, such as Type Ia supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS). In this work, we focus on the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, i.e., secondary CMB fluctuations generated by evolving gravitational potentials due to the transition between, e.g., the matter and dark energy (DE) dominated phases. Therefore, assuming a flat universe, DE properties can be inferred from ISW detections. We present a Bayesian approach to compute the CMB-LSS cross-correlation signal. The method is based on the estimate of the likelihood for measuring a combined set consisting of a CMB temperature and a galaxy contrast maps, provided that we have some information on the statistical properties of the fluctuations affecting these maps. The likelihood is estimated by a sampling algorithm, therefore avoiding the computationally demanding techniques of direct evaluation in either pixel or harmonic space. As local tracers of the matter distribution at large scales, we used the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) galaxy catalog and, for the CMB temperature fluctuations, the ninth-year data release of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP9). The results show a dominance of cosmic variance over the weak recovered signal, due mainly to the shallowness of the catalog used, with systematics associated with the sampling algorithm playing a secondary role as sources of uncertainty. When combined with other complementary probes, the method presented in this paper is expected to be a useful tool to late-time acceleration studies in cosmology.

This makes it essential to infer the redshift of the source independently to measure the expansion history of the Universe. We show that by exploiting the clustering scale of the gravitational wave sources with galaxies of known redshift, we can infer the expansion history from redshift unknown gravitational wave sources. Using gravitational wave sources with unknown redshift that are detectable from the network of gravitational wave detectors with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, we will be able to obtain accurate and precise measurements of the local Hubble constant, the expansion history of the universe, and the gravitational wave bias parameter, which captures the distribution of gravitational wave sources with respect to the redshift tracer distribution. This technique is not only limited to the low redshift gravitational wave sources, but will be also applicable to the high redshift gravitational wave sources detectable from Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Cosmic Explorer (CE), and Einstein Telescope (ET). Moreover, this method is also going to be applicable to samples of supernovae and fast radio bursts with unknown or photometric redshifts.},

One of the smoking-gun predictions of such theories is the change in the GW luminosity distance to GW sources as a function of redshift relative to the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance expected from EM probes. We propose a multimessenger test of the theory of general relativity from the propagation of GWs by combining EM and GW observations to resolve these issues from GW sources without EM counterparts (which are also referred to as dark standard sirens). By using the relation between the geometric distances accessible from baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and luminosity distance measurements from the GW sources, we can measure any deviation from the general theory of relativity via the GW sources of unknown redshift that will be detectable by networks of GW detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. Using this technique, the fiducial value of the frictional term can be measured to a precision \$\textbackslash Xi \_0=0.98\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.23\}\$ after marginalizing over redshift dependence, cosmological parameters, and GW bias parameters with {$\sim$}3500 dark standard sirens of masses \$30\textbackslash, \textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$ each distributed up to redshift z = 0.5. For a fixed redshift dependence, a value of \$\textbackslash Xi \_0=0.99\^\{+0.02\}\_\{-0.02\}\$ can be measured with a similar number of dark sirens. Application of our methodology to the far more numerous dark standard sirens detectable with next-generation GW detectors, such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will allow achievement of higher accuracy than possible from use of bright standard sirens.},

  abstract = {The matter in our Universe comes in two flavors: dark and baryonic. Of these, only the latter couples to photons, giving rise to the well-known baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) and, in the process, generating supersonic relative velocities between dark matter and baryons. These velocities-imprinted with the acoustic scale in their genesis-impede the formation of the first stars during cosmic dawn (z {$\sim$} 20), modulating the expected 21-cm signal from this era. In a companion paper we showed, combining numerical simulations and analytic models, that this modulation takes the form of striking velocity-induced acoustic oscillations (VAOs), with a well-understood shape that is frozen at recombination, and unaffected by the unknown astrophysics of star formation. Here we propose using these VAOs as a standard ruler at cosmic dawn. We find that three years of 21-cm power-spectrum data from the upcoming HERA interferometer will be able to measure the Hubble expansion rate H(z) at z = 15 - 20 to percent-level precision, ranging from 0.3\% to 11\% depending on the strength of astrophysical feedback processes and foregrounds. This would provide a new handle on the expansion rate of our Universe during an otherwise unprobed epoch, opening a window to the mysterious cosmic-dawn era. The 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen is set to revolutionize our understanding of the Universe, providing access to a large cosmic volume unobservable by other probes. Of particular interest is the cosmic-dawn era, spanning the redshift range z = 15 - 30, which saw the formation of the first stars. These stars filled the Universe with ultraviolet (UV) photons, exciting the hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen and allowing it to efficiently absorb 21-cm photons from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) [1-3]. In addition, hydrogen was later reheated by the abundant X-rays produced by stellar formation, eventually sourcing 21-cm emission against the CMB [4-6]. These two effects allow us to indirectly map the distribution of the first star-forming galaxies during cosmic dawn through the 21-cm hydrogen line. The first galaxies formed out of matter overdensities at small scales [7-9], where baryons and dark matter (DM) do not behave identically. After matter-radiation equality the DM started clustering efficiently under its own gravity. Baryons, on the other hand, were impeded to do so by their interactions with photons, producing the well-known baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) [10, 11]. This discrepancy also generated relative velocities between the two fluids [12], which fluctuate on acoustic scales and, due to their supersonic nature, strongly suppress the formation of the first stars. Physically, this suppression arises from three sources. First, large relative velocities damp matter fluctuations at small scales, thus lowering the amount of haloes that can form [12-14]. Second, they allow baryons to stream away from each halo, reducing the amount of gas available for star formation [15-17]. Last, the relative velocities smear overdense gas cores, impeding said gas to cool and form stars [18-23]. The combination of these effects imprints the distribution of stars-and thus the 21-cm power spectrum-with acoustic oscillations during the cosmic-dawn era [24-28]. In Ref. [28] we showed, via semi-numerical simulations with 21cmvFAST (a publicly available version of 21cmFAST [29, 30] modified to include streaming velocities), that these unique velocity-induced acoustic oscillations (VAOs) have an analytically understood shape, fixed at recombination [16, 31, 32], which is largely impervious to the complex astrophysics of star formation. In this Letter we propose employing a prospective detection of VAOs in the 21-cm power spectrum as a standard ruler to the enigmatic cosmic-dawn era. The procedure to use VAOs as a standard ruler is similar to regular BAO analyses of galaxy surveys, with two major differences. First, while matter overdensities are affected by both gravity and the BAOs, relative velocities are only sourced by the latter. Thus, even though the matter density fluctuates only at the percent level due to the acoustic oscillations [33, 34], the relative velocities fluctuate by order unity at acoustic scales [12], which simplifies the task of modeling the VAOs. Second, galaxy surveys detect roughly isotropically in Fourier space whereas, due to their foreground structure, 21-cm observations are heavily biased towards k-modes along the line of sight [35-38]. This hampers a detection of the angular-diameter distance with VAOs, although we will show that it allows for a percent-level measurement of the Hubble expansion rate H(z) of our Universe during cosmic dawn (z = 15 - 20). Such a measurement would allow us to probe the state of our Universe at an earlier cosmic epoch than any BAO survey. We illustrate this in Fig. 1, where we show measurements of H(z) through regular BAOs with current datasets [39-42], as well as with the future Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) [43], which in no case can reach redshifts farther than z {$\sim$} 5. VAOs, on the other hand, allow us to probe the z {$\sim$} 20 era, deep into the matter-dominated regime, providing a useful test of exotic physics, such as early dark energy [44-47] and decaying DM [48].

  abstract = {As part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will improve measurements of the cosmological distance scale by applying the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) method to quasar samples. eBOSS will adopt two approaches to target quasars over 7500 deg2. First, a ``CORE'' quasar sample will combine the optical selection in ugriz using a likelihood-based routine called XDQSOz, with a mid-IR-optical color cut. eBOSS CORE selection (to g{$<$}22 or r{$<$}22) should return {$\sim$}70 deg-2 quasars at redshifts 0.9{$<$}z{$<$}2.2 and {$\sim$}7 deg-2z{$>$}2.1 quasars. Second, a selection based on variability in multi-epoch imaging from the Palomar Transient Factory should recover an additional {$\sim$}3\textendash 4 deg-2z{$>$}2.1 quasars to g{$<$}22.5. A linear model of how imaging systematics affect target density recovers the angular distribution of eBOSS CORE quasars over 96.7\% (76.7\%) of the SDSS north (south) Galactic Cap area. The eBOSS CORE quasar sample should thus be sufficiently dense and homogeneous over 0.9{$<$}z{$<$}2.2 to yield the first few-percent-level BAO constraint near z\textasciimacron{} \textasciitilde{} 1.5.eBOSS quasars at z{$>$}2.1 will be used to improve BAO measurements in the Ly{$\alpha$} Forest.

At the conclusion of eBOSS, the SDSS will have provided unique spectra for more than 800,000 quasars.},

In this paper we show how to capture some of this information by using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), for the first time using it to estimate cosmological parameters in simulations. Discrete tracers of dark matter such as galaxies, \$N\$-body particles or haloes are used as nodes to construct a unique graph, the MST, which is defined to be the minimum weighted spanning graph. We study the dependence of the MST statistics on cosmological parameters using haloes from a suite of COLA simulations with a box size of \$250\textbackslash{} h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$ that vary the amplitude of scalar fluctuations \$\textbackslash left(A\_\{\textbackslash rm s\}\textbackslash right)\$, matter density \$\textbackslash left(\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}\textbackslash right)\$ and neutrino mass \$\textbackslash left(\textbackslash sum m\_\{\textbackslash nu\}\textbackslash right)\$. The power spectrum \$P(k)\$ and bispectrum \$B(k\_\{1\}, k\_\{2\}, k\_\{3\})\$ are measured between \$k\$ \$\textbackslash sim 0.125\$ and \$0.5\$ \$h\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, while a corresponding lower cut of \$\textbackslash sim12.6\$ \$h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$ is applied to the MST. The constraints from the individual methods are fairly similar but when combined we see improved \$1\textbackslash sigma\$ constraints on \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}\$ of \$\textbackslash sim 17\textbackslash\%\$ with respect to \$P(k)\$ and \$\textbackslash sim 12\textbackslash\%\$ with respect to \$P(k)+B(k\_\{1\}, k\_\{2\}, k\_\{3\})\$ thus showing the MST is providing additional information not present in the power spectrum and bispectrum. The MST is a tool which can be used to constrain parameters and/or to test systematics in current and future galaxy surveys. This is especially applicable to spectroscopy surveys (BOSS, DESI, Euclid, PSF, WFIRST and 4MOST) where the MST can be applied in 3D comoving coordinates and photometric surveys (DES and LSST) in tomographic shells. The Python code, MiSTree, used to construct the MST and run the analysis, is made publicly available at https://knaidoo29.github.io/mistreedoc/.},

We analyse the abundance ratios of magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation (stellar masses log (M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$}) {$\sim$} 9.7-11.2). Comparison of observed magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way with the stellar abundances in our more than 850 Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. Here, we use the magnesium-to-iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII (core-collapse supernovae) and SNIa (Type Ia supernovae) metal return prescription and as a comparison to a variety of galactic observations. The europium-to-iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star-neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, and is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present-day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. We reproduce the europium-to-iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, and find it is sensitive to gas properties during redshifts z {$\approx$} 2-4. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is quite robust.},

To extract cosmological information, previously proposed cosmological studies using the GW standard sirens rely on source redshift information obtained through an extensive electromagnetic follow-up campaign. However, the redshift identification is typically time consuming and rather challenging. Here, we propose a novel method for cosmology with the GW standard sirens free from the redshift measurements. Utilizing the anisotropies of the number density and luminosity distances of compact binaries originated from the large-scale structure, we show that, once GW observations will be well established in the future, (i) these anisotropies can be measured even at very high redshifts (z {$\geq$} 2), where the identification of the electromagnetic counterpart is difficult, (ii) the expected constraints on the primordial non-Gaussianity with the Einstein Telescope would be comparable to or even better than the other large-scale structure probes at the same epoch, and (iii) the cross-correlation with other cosmological observations is found to have high-statistical significance, providing additional cosmological information at very high redshifts.},

  abstract = {The first discovery of the gravitational-wave (GW) event, GW150914, suggests a higher merger rate of black-hole (BH) binaries. If this is true, a number of BH binaries will be observed via the second-generation GW detectors, and the statistical properties of the observed BH binaries can be scrutinized. A naive but important question to ask is whether the spatial distribution of BH binaries faithfully traces the matter inhomogeneities in the Universe or not. Although the BH binaries are thought to be formed inside the galaxies in most of the scenarios, there is no observational evidence to confirm such a hypothesis. Here, we estimate how well the second-generation GW detectors can statistically confirm the BH binaries to be a tracer of the large-scale structure by looking at the auto- and cross-correlation of BH binaries with photometric galaxies and weak-lensing measurements, finding that, with a 3 year observation, the {$>$}3{$\sigma$} detection of a nonzero signal is possible if the BH merger rate today is \.n0100 Gpc-3 yr-1 and the clustering bias of BH binaries is bBH,0 1.5.},

  abstract = {I consider the puzzles arising from four interrelated problems involving `anthropic' reasoning, and in particular the `Self-Sampling Assumption' (SSA) - that one should reason as if one were randomly chosen from the set of all observers in a suitable reference class. The problem of Freak Observers might appear to force acceptance of SSA if any empirical evidence is to be credited. The Sleeping Beauty problem arguably shows that one should also accept the `Self-Indication Assumption' (SIA) - that one should take one's own existence as evidence that the number of observers is more likely to be large than small. But this assumption produces apparently absurd results in the Presumptuous Philosopher problem. Without SIA, however, a definitive refutation of the counterintuitive Doomsday Argument seems difficult. I show that these problems are satisfyingly resolved by applying the principle that one should always condition on all evidence - not just on the fact that you are an intelligent observer, or that you are human, but on the fact that you are a human with a specific set of memories. This `Full Non-indexical Conditioning' (FNC) approach usually produces the same results as assuming both SSA and SIA, with a sufficiently broad reference class, while avoiding their ad hoc aspects. I argue that the results of FNC are correct using the device of hypothetical ``companion'' observers, whose existence clarifies what principles of reasoning are valid. I conclude by discussing how one can use FNC to infer how densely we should expect intelligent species to occur, and by examining recent anthropic arguments in inflationary and string theory cosmology.},

Here, we present first results on the galaxy colour bimodality at low redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g - r) colours of 109 {$<$} M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 1012.5 galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement with the observations, with a sharp transition in median colour from blue to red at a characteristic M{$\star$} {$\sim$} 1010.5 M{$\odot$}. Investigating the build-up of the colour-mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy colour transition is supermassive black hole feedback in its low accretion state. Across the entire population the median colour transition time-scale {$\Delta$}tgreen is {$\sim$}1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower star formation rates, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence. Galaxies with M{$\star$} {$>$} 1011 M{$\odot$} which redden at z {$<$} 1 accumulate on average {$\sim$}25 per cent of their final z = 0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, {$\sim$}18 per cent of such massive galaxies acquire half or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.},

  abstract = {For dark matter (DM) particles with masses in the 0.6 - 6 m p range, we set stringent constraints on the interaction cross-sections for scattering with ordi-nary baryonic matter. These constraints follow from the recognition that such particles can be captured by \textendash{} and thermalized within \textendash{} the Earth, leading to a substantial accumulation and concentration of DM that interact with baryons. Here, we discuss the probability that DM intercepted by the Earth will be cap-tured, the number of DM particles thereby accumulated over Earth's lifetime, the fraction of such particles retained in the face of evaporation, and the den-sity distribution of such particles within the Earth. These considerations lead to an estimate of the DM particle density at Earth's surface, which may exceed 10 14 cm -3 for the mass range under consideration. Based upon our determina-tion of the DM density at Earth's surface, we derive constraints on the scattering cross-sections. These constraints are placed by four considerations: (1) the life-time of the relativistic proton beam at the Large Hadron collider (LHC); (2) the orbital decay of spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO); (3) the vaporization rate of cryogenic liquids in well-insulated storage dewars; and (4) the thermal conduc-tivity of Earth's crust. As an example application of our results, we show that for the scattering cross-sections that were invoked recently in Barkana's original explanation for the anomalously deep 21 cm absorption reported by EDGES, DM particle masses in the 0.6 - 4m p range are ruled out.},

  abstract = {Dark matter with a non-zero self-interacting cross section (\$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm SIDM\}\$) has been posited as a solution to a number of outstanding astrophysical mysteries. Many studies of merging galaxy clusters have given constraints on \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm SIDM\}\$ based on the spatial offset between the member galaxy population and the dark matter distribution. Assuming \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm SIDM\} = 0\$, how likely is it for us to see the galaxy-DM offset values observed in merging clusters of galaxies? To answer this question, we formulate a hypothesis test using data from Illustris, a \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmological simulation. We select 43 Illustris clusters and their galaxy members at z\textasciitilde 0 and examine the accuracy of commonly used galaxy summary statistics, including kernel-density-estimation (KDE) luminosity peak, KDE number density peak, shrinking aperture, centroid and the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use the dark-matter particles to reproduce commonly adopted methods to identify dark-matter peaks based on gravitational lensing cluster maps. By analysing each cluster in 768 projections, we determine the optimistic noise floor in the measurements of the galaxy-DM offsets. We find that the choice of the galaxy summary statistics affects the inferred offset values substantially, with the BCG and the luminosity peak giving the tightest 68-th percentile offset levels, \$\textbackslash lesssim\$ 4 kpc and \$\textbackslash lesssim\$ 32 kpc, respectively. Shrinking aperture, number density and centroid give a large offset scatter of about 50-100 kpc at the 68-th percentile level, even for clusters with only one dominant mass component. Out of the 15 reported offsets from observed merging clusters that we examined, 13 of them are consistent with Illustris unrelaxed cluster offsets at the 2-sigma (95-th percentile) level, i.e. consistent with the hypothesis that \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM is the true underlying physical model.},

We identify reliable indicators that separate Galactic/local from extragalactic sources and concentrate here on the objects in our Galaxy and its closest satellites. We develop colour and magnitude criteria that are based only on WISE data to select asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with circumstellar dust shells, and separate them into O-rich and C-rich classes. With these criteria we produce an all-sky map for the count ratio of the two populations. The map reveals differences between the Galactic disc, the Magellanic Clouds and the Sgr Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy, as well as a radial gradient in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disc. We find that the C:O number ratio for dusty AGB stars increases with distance from the LMC centre about twice as fast as measured for near-IR selected samples of early AGB stars. Detailed radiative transfer models show that WISE colours are well explained by the emission of centrally heated dusty shells where the dust has standard properties of interstellar medium (ISM) grains. The segregation of different classes of objects in WISE colour space arises from differences in properties of the dust shells: those around young stellar objects have uniform density distributions while in evolved stars they have steep radial profiles.},

We assess the performance of the emulator using a validation set of N-body simulations that are not used in training the emulator. We show that, for typical halos hosting CMASS galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the emulator predicts the halo-matter cross correlation, relevant for galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with an accuracy better than 2\% and the halo auto-correlation, relevant for galaxy clustering correlation, with an accuracy better than 4\%. We give several demonstrations of the emulator. It can be used to study properties of halo mass density profiles such as the mass-concentration relation and splashback radius for different cosmologies. The emulator outputs can be combined with an analytical prescription of halo-galaxy connection such as the halo occupation distribution at the equation level, instead of using the mock catalogs, to make accurate predictions of galaxy clustering statistics such as the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and the projected correlation function for any model within the wCDM cosmologies, in a few CPU seconds.

  title = {Atmospheric Effects},
  urldate = {2018-09-17},
  abstract = {Ground-based astronomers must reckon with the effect of the atmosphere on their observations. The atmosphere imprints wavelength-dependent absorption on the incoming light. It glows with a complex, time-dependent and space-dependent spectrum. It refracts the light as a function of zenith angle and wavelength. Finally, turbulence in the atmosphere distorts the incoming light's wave fronts, leading to image motion and blur. When calculating the effects of the atmosphere, the zenith angle z is a critical factor. In the plane-parallel approximation, which virtually always holds, the column density of atmosphere at z scales as the airmass, a = 1/ cos z. Figure 1 shows the atmospheric transmission at zenith t(z = 0 \textbullet ) as a function of wavelength at sea level. The transmission at other airmasses is: t(z) = [t(z = 0 \textbullet )] a , (1) where a is the airmass. It also depends on height above sea level. The sharp absorption features are known as telluric lines; the strongest of these are the Fraunhofer A and B bands around 7000-7500\AA{} 7500\AA, due to O 2. The ultraviolet and higher energy photons are essentially entirely absorbed below 3500\AA 3500\AA, mostly due to ozone. Starting in the near-infrared and continuing to about mm wavelengths, the atmosphere has strong absorption bands associated with water vapor and carbon dioxide. The exact level of absorption depends on the humidity, pressure, and temperature. This means the transmission spectra depends on time and the average conditions vary considerably between different locations. Favorable locations include but are not limited to the high deserts of Chile and the South Pole. Figure 2 shows the atmospheric emission as a function of wavelength. The components of this emission include a scattered light component. This scattered light comes primarily from ground sources and the Moon. When the Moon is out it tends to dominate the continuum regions of the sky spectra; this spectrum then resembles the solar spectrum. Other scattered light yields a spectrum that reflects the light source, often from mercury or sodium lines due to artificial lighting (with the sodium lines occasionally containing a broad component due to high pressure sodium lamps; Osterbrock et al. 1976). The scattered light emission is dependent on Moon phase and angle to the Moon (or to other sources) and is fairly smoothly varying in time and angle. Emission also originates from the atmosphere itself. In the optical and near-infrared, this emission is dominated by fluorescence due to excitation of atoms and molecules, known as airglow. Neutral oxygen has several important lines, and OH exhibits a suite of rotation-vibrational modes},

Our results cover a large range of scales from {$\sim$}500 to {$\sim$}90 h-1 Mpc. We compare these estimates with the expectations of the flat A cold dark matter (ACDM) standard cosmological model with parameters compatible with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 data. We use the MultiDark cosmological simulation, one of the largest N-body runs presently available, together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, to estimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloes and galaxy biases. We find that the ACDM model gives a reasonable description to the observed correlation functions at z {$\approx$} 0.5, which is remarkably good agreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance of BOSS galaxies, does not have any free parameters. However, we find a {$\geq$}10 per cent deviation in the correlation functions for scales {$\leq$} 1 and {$\sim$}10-40 h-1 Mpc. A more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics from upcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. We also estimate that about 12 per cent of the 'galaxies' in the abundance-matched sample are satellites inhabiting central haloes with mass M {$\geq$} 1014 h-1 M{$\odot$}. Using the MultiDark simulation, we also study the real-space halo bias b of the matched catalogue finding that b = 2.00 {$\pm$} 0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtained using the measured BOSS-projected correlation function. Furthermore, the linear large-scale bias, defined using the extrapolated linear matter power spectrum, depends on the number density n of the abundance-matched sample as b=-0.048- (0.594 {$\pm$} 0.02)log10(n/ h3 Mpc-3). Extrapolating these results to baryon acoustic oscillation scales, we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signal produced by non-linear evolution that leads to {$\sim$}2-4 per cent dips at {$\geq$} 3s level for wavenumbers k {$\geq$} 0.1 h Mpc-1 in the linear large-scale bias. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {We present a novel test of the cosmological principle: the idea that, on sufficiently large scales, the universe should appear homogeneous and isotropic to observers comoving with the Hubble flow. This is a fundamental assumption in modern cosmology, underpinning the use of the Friedmann-Lema\textbackslash\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric as part of the concordance \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM paradigm. However, the observed dipole imprinted on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is interpreted as our departure from the Hubble flow, and such a proper motion will induce a directionally-dependent time dilation over the sky. We illustrate the feasibility of detection of this 'time dilation dipole' and sketch the practical steps involved in its extraction from a catalogue of sources with intrinsic time-scales. In essence, whilst the scale of this dilation is small, being of order of 0.1\%, it will in principle be detectable in large scale surveys of variable cosmological sources, such as quasars and supernovae. The degree of alignment of the time dilation dipole with the kinematic dipole derived from the CMB will provide a new assessment of the cosmological principle, and address the tension in dipole measures from other observations.},

Continuous approaches capture rotational equivariance but are often prohibitively computationally demanding. Discrete approaches offer more favorable computational performance but at the cost of equivariance. We develop a hybrid discrete-continuous (DISCO) group convolution that is simultaneously equivariant and computationally scalable to high-resolution. While our framework can be applied to any compact group, we specialize to the sphere. Our DISCO spherical convolutions exhibit \$\textbackslash text\{SO\}(3)\$ rotational equivariance, where \$\textbackslash text\{SO\}(n)\$ is the special orthogonal group representing rotations in \$n\$-dimensions. When restricting rotations of the convolution to the quotient space \$\textbackslash text\{SO\}(3)/\textbackslash text\{SO\}(2)\$ for further computational enhancements, we recover a form of asymptotic \$\textbackslash text\{SO\}(3)\$ rotational equivariance. Through a sparse tensor implementation we achieve linear scaling in number of pixels on the sphere for both computational cost and memory usage. For 4k spherical images we realize a saving of \$10\^9\$ in computational cost and \$10\^4\$ in memory usage when compared to the most efficient alternative equivariant spherical convolution. We apply the DISCO spherical CNN framework to a number of benchmark dense-prediction problems on the sphere, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, on all of which we achieve the state-of-the-art performance.},

This article, which draws from a qualitative, longitudinal study, addresses this gap by focusing on ten minority female physics students who negotiate three incongruent realms: field of study, gender, and race/ ethnicity. It examines ways in which these students sense that their belonging and competence in science are questioned because their bodies do not conform to prevalent images of the "ordinary" white male physicist. To persevere in physics, they engage in bodily projects of (1) approximating ordinariness through fragmentation, which entails using strategies of racial or gendered "passing," or (2) rejecting these practices in favor of multiplicity, which entails employing stereotype manipulation or performances of superiority. By highlighting accounts of individuals who persevere in the elite physics field, this article provides insight into how university departments should reform to promote more women and underrepresented minorities in science. \textcopyright{} 2005 by Society for the Study of Social Problems, Inc.

In this paper, we investigate their sensitivities to the impact of neutrino property on the growth of density fluctuations, such as the total neutrino mass, the effective number of neutrino species (extra radiation), and the neutrino mass hierarchy. We show that by combining a precise CMB polarization observation such as Simons Array with a 21 cm line observation such as Square kilometer Array (SKA) phase 1 and a baryon acoustic oscillation observation (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument:DESI) we can measure effects of non-zero neutrino mass on the growth of density fluctuation if the total neutrino mass is larger than 0.1 eV. Additionally, the combinations can strongly improve errors of the bounds on the effective number of neutrino species {$\sigma$} (N{$\nu$}) {$\sim$} 0.06-0.09 at 95 \% C.L.. Finally, by using SKA phase 2, we can determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at 95 \% C.L. if the total neutrino mass is similar to or smaller than 0.1 eV.},

This allows a direct comparison with theory, without modeling redshift space distortions and the large scale correlation function. This has a number of advantages over the more traditional w\_p estimator, including (i) an insensitivity to large scale structures and the details of the truncation of the line of sight integral, (ii) a compact kernel in xi(r), and (iii) being unbinned.

When the redshifts of the host galaxies are known, these events can be used as `standard sirens', sensitive to the expansion rate of the Universe. Measurements of the Hubble constant \$H\_0\$ from standard sirens can be done independently of other cosmological probes, and events occurring at \$z{$<$}0.1\$ will allow us to infer \$H\_0\$ independently of cosmological models. The next generation of spectroscopic galaxy surveys will play a crucial role in reducing systematic uncertainties in \$H\_0\$ from standard sirens, particularly for the numerous `dark sirens' which do not have an electromagnetic counterpart. In combination with large spectroscopic data sets, standard sirens with an EM counterpart are expected to constrain \$H\_0\$ to \$\textbackslash sim 1-2\textbackslash\%\$ precision within the next decade. This is competitive with the best estimates of \$H\_0\$ obtained to date and will help illuminate the current tension between existing measurements. Information on the galaxies that host the gravitational wave events will also shed light on the origin and evolution of compact object binaries.},

  abstract = {Cosmological simulations aim to understand the matter distribution in the universe either by following a semi-analytic approach or by formulating a hydrodynamical version of the matter distribution. Both approaches describe the evolution of baryonic structures inside potential wells created by dark matter, while the dark matter itself is modelled as self gravitating collision-less system. While major advancements have been made to reduce the computational costs, these simulations still take millions of CPU hours to converge to a stable set of solutions. This naturally leads to the question: can generative models predict the properties of a galaxy, given a partial history of its dynamical evolution? Given that computing conditional probabilities is intractable in general, tractable probabilistic models such as sumproduct networks have emerged, where conditional marginals can be computed in time linear in the size of the model. In this work, we investigate how sum-product networks can be used to compactly represent and learn distributions for prediction in concordance cosmology. Our results study the extent to which they can infer the relation between baryonic matter and dark matter. We test the algorithm on the Eagle suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to show that graphical models can satisfactorily reproduce mock catalogs of galaxies.},

We select galaxies with redshift 0.452 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.625 and with a stellar mass M stellar {$>$} 10 11.56 M . We study the topology at two smoothing lengths: R G = 21 h -1 Mpc and R G = 34 h -1 Mpc. The genus topology studied at the R G = 21 h -1 Mpc scale results in the highest genus amplitude observed to date. The CMASS sample yields a genus curve that is characteristic of one produced by Gaussian random phase initial conditions. The data thus support the standard model of inflation where random quantum fluctuations in the early universe produced Gaussian random phase initial conditions. Modest deviations in the observed genus from random phase are as expected from shot noise effects and the nonlinear evolution of structure. We suggest the use of a fitting formula motivated by perturbation theory to characterize the shift and asymmetries in the observed genus curve with a single parameter. We construct 54 mock SDSS CMASS surveys along the past light cone from the Horizon Run 3 (HR3) N-body simulations, where gravitationally bound dark matter subhalos are identified as the sites of galaxy formation. We study the genus topology of the HR3 mock surveys with the same geometry and sampling density as the observational sample and find the observed genus topology to be consistent with {$\Lambda$}CDM as simulated by the HR3 mock samples. We conclude that the topology of the large-scale structure in the SDSS CMASS sample is consistent with cosmological models having primordial Gaussian density fluctuations growing in accordance with general relativity to form galaxies in massive dark matter halos.},

  abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We first show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. The quasi-linear mass correlations are in fact reproduced well by a model of independent randomly-placed haloes. The distribution of galaxies within the halo density field depends on: (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number - the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. This second assumption is essential if small-scale galaxy correlations are to remain close to a single power law, rather than flattening in the same way as the correlations of the overall density field. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat {$\Omega$}=0.3 model ({$\Lambda$}CDM), but not for an {$\Omega$}=1 model with the same power spectrum ({$\tau$}CDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high {$\Omega$}, and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the {$\Lambda$}CDM model is lower than that of the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

  abstract = {We present a budget and accounting of metals in and around star-forming galaxies at \$z\textbackslash sim 0\$. We combine empirically derived star formation histories with updated supernova and AGB yields and rates to estimate the total mass of metals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of \$10\^\{9.3\}\$--\$10\^\{11.6\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. On the accounting side of the ledger, we show that a surprisingly constant 20--25\% mass fraction of produced metals remain in galaxies' stars, interstellar gas and interstellar dust, with little dependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass (omitting those metals immediately locked up in remnants). Thus, the bulk of metals are outside of galaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's \$L\^*\$ galaxies. The COS-Halos survey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalactic medium (to impact parameters of \${$<$} 150\$ kpc) of low-redshift \$\textbackslash sim L\^*\$ galaxies. Using these data, we map the distribution of CGM metals as traced by both the highly ionized OVI ion and a suite of low-ionization species; combined with constraints on circumgalactic dust and hotter X-ray emitting gas out to similar impact parameters, we show that \$\textbackslash sim 40\$\% of metals produced by \$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\textbackslash sim 10\^\{10\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ galaxies can be easily accounted for out to 150 kpc. With the current data, we cannot rule out a constant mass of metals within this fixed physical radius. This census provides a crucial boundary condition for the eventual fate of metals in galaxy evolution models.},

Since these models are becoming computationally very expensive and display non-trivial uncertainties, the use of standard Bayesian algorithms for cosmological inferences, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), might become inadequate. Here, we propose a new approach to parameter estimation based on an iterative Gaussian emulation of the target likelihood function. This requires a minimal number of likelihood evaluations and naturally accommodates for stochasticity in theoretical models. We apply the algorithm to estimate 9 parameters from the monopole and quadrupole of a mock power spectrum in redshift space. We obtain accurate posterior distribution functions with approximately 100 times fewer likelihood evaluations than an affine invariant MCMC, roughly independently from the dimensionality of the problem. We anticipate that our parameter estimation algorithm will accelerate the adoption of more accurate theoretical models in data analysis, enabling more comprehensive exploitation of cosmological observables.},

In this paper, we extend previous work on this contribution to the error budget, deriving formulae for errors measured by integrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fitting parameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix. Both are situations that previous analyses of BOSS have considered. We apply the formulae derived to baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from BOSS in our companion papers. To further aid these analyses, we consider the optimum number of bins to use for two-point measurements using the monopole power spectrum or correlation function for BAO, and the monopole and quadrupole moments of the correlation function for anisotropic-BAO and RSD measurements. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

Neural networks are powerful and capable of probing deep patterns in data, but must be trained carefully on large and representative data sets. We developed and generated a new `hump' of the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project: CAMELS-SAM, encompassing one thousand dark-matter only simulations of (100 \$h\^\{-1\}\$ cMpc)\$\^3\$ with different cosmological parameters (\$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$) and run through the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model for galaxy formation over a broad range of astrophysical parameters. As a proof-of-concept for the power of this vast suite of simulated galaxies in a large volume and broad parameter space, we probe the power of simple clustering summary statistics to marginalize over astrophysics and constrain cosmology using neural networks. We use the two-point correlation function, count-in-cells, and the Void Probability Function, and probe non-linear and linear scales across \$0.68{$<\$$} R \${$<$}27\textbackslash{} h\^\{-1\}\$ cMpc. Our cosmological constraints cluster around 3-8\$\textbackslash\%\$ error on \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash text\{M\}\}\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, and we explore the effect of various galaxy selections, galaxy sampling, and choice of clustering statistics on these constraints. We additionally explore how these clustering statistics constrain and inform key stellar and galactic feedback parameters in the Santa Cruz SAM. CAMELS-SAM has been publicly released alongside the rest of CAMELS, and offers great potential to many applications of machine learning in astrophysics: https://camels-sam.readthedocs.io.},

These observations, also known as " cosmic anomalies " include unexpected Cosmic Microwave Background perturbations on large angular scales, large dipolar peculiar velocity flows of galaxies (" bulk flows "), the measurement of inhomogenous values of the fine structure constant on cosmological scales (" alpha dipole ") and other effects. The presence of the observational anomalies could either be a large statistical fluctuation in the context of {$\Lambda$}CDM or it could indicate a non-trivial departure from the cosmological principle on Hubble scales. Such a departure is very much constrained by cosmological observations for matter. For dark energy however there are no significant observational constraints for Hubble scale inhomogeneities. In this brief review I discuss some of the theoretical models that can naturally lead to inhomogeneous dark energy, their observational constraints and their potential to explain the large scale cosmic anomalies.},

  abstract = {Conventional algorithms for galaxy power spectrum estimation measure the true spectrum convolved with a survey window function, which, for parameter inference, must be compared with a similarly convolved theory model. In this work, we directly estimate the unwindowed power spectrum multipoles using quadratic estimators akin to those introduced in the late 1990s. Under Gaussian assumptions, these are optimal and free from the leading-order effects of pixellization and non-Poissonian shot-noise. They may be straightforwardly computed given the survey data-set and a suite of simulations of known cosmology. We implement the pixel-based maximum-likelihood estimator and a simplification based on the FKP weighting scheme, both of which can be computed via FFTs and conjugate gradient descent methods. Furthermore, the estimators allow direct computation of spectrum coefficients in an arbitrary linear compression scheme, without needing to first bin the statistico. Applying the technique to a subset of the BOSS DR12 galaxies, we find that the pixel-based quadratic estimators give statistically consistent power spectra, compressed coefficients, and cosmological parameters to those obtained with the usual windowed approaches. Due to the sample's low number density and compact window function, the optimal weighting scheme gives little improvement over the simplified form; this may change for dense surveys or those focusing on primordial non-Gaussianity. The technique is shown to be efficient and robust, and shows significant potential for measuring the windowless power spectrum and bispectrum in the presence of weak non-Gaussianity.},

We incorporate all effects necessary for comparison to data: fourth-order galaxy bias, infrared resummation (accounting for the non-linear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations), ultraviolet counterterms, non-linear redshift-space distortions, stochastic contributions, projection, and binning effects. The model is implemented using FFTLog, and validated with the PT Challenge suite of \$N\$-body simulations, whose large volume allows for high-precision tests. Focusing on the mass fluctuation amplitude, \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, and galaxy bias parameters, we find that including one-loop corrections allow us to significantly extend the range of scales over which the bispectrum can be modeled, and greatly tightens constraints on bias parameters. However, this does not lead to noticeable improvements in the \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ errorbar due to the necessary marginalization over a large number of nuisance parameters with conservative priors. Analyzing a BOSS-volume likelihood, we find that the addition of the one-loop bispectrum may lead to improvements on primordial non-Gaussianity constraints by \$\textbackslash lesssim 30\textbackslash\%\$ and on \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ by \$\textbackslash approx 10\textbackslash\%\$, though we caution that this requires pushing the analysis to short scales where the galaxy bias parameters may not be correctly recovered; this may lead to biases in the recovered parameter values. We conclude that restrictive priors from simulations or higher-order statistics such as the bispectrum multipoles will be needed in order to realize the full information content of the galaxy bispectrum.},

What new information does it contain beyond conventional statistics? Through the development of a perturbative model, we find that the mark induces a significant coupling between small-scale non-Gaussianities and large scales, leading to the additional information content. The model is derived in the context of one-loop perturbation theory and validated by comparison to \$N\$-body simulations across a variety of mark parameters. At moderate redshifts, including for massive neutrino cosmologies, the theory is in good agreement with the simulations. The mixing of large and small scales complicates the modeling as there is no well-defined convergence radius of the theory at low \$z\$. Extension to higher perturbative order and biased tracers is possible via a similar approach, and a simple model of the latter is shown to yield promising results. The theory becomes non-perturbative at redshift zero for small smoothing scales. This suggests that marked spectrum may have important contributions from baryonic effects even at low \$k\$: these will need to be studied before the full power of this tool can be realized.},

The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intracluster light. Haloes more massive than about 5 \texttimes{} 1014 M{$\odot$} have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( - 3.5 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\alpha$}3D {$\lessequivlnt$} -3). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at z = 0, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as {$\propto$}(M500c)0.49 with a {$\sim$}0.12 dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of The Next Generation less-massive galaxies ( {$\lessequivlnt$} 1011 M{$\odot$} in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of massive galaxies fall too on a tight ({$\sim$}0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, with r\^stars\_0.5 {$\propto$} (M\_200c)\^\{0.53\}. Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kiloparsecs, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single-mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.},

Here we investigate the structural and kinematical evolution of star-forming galaxies across cosmic time (0 {$<$} z {$<$} 6). We quantify their sizes, disk heights, 3D shapes, and degree of rotational vs. dispersion-supported motions as traced by rest-frame V-band light (i.e. roughly stellar mass) and by Halpha light (i.e. star-forming and dense gas). The unprecedented resolution of TNG50 enables us to model galaxies with sub-kpc half-light radii and with {$<$}300-pc disk heights. Coupled with the large-volume statistics, we characterize a diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical morphological mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs. Our model predicts that for star-forming galaxies the fraction of disk-like morphologies, based on 3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass. Gas kinematics reveal that the vast majority of 10\^9-11.5 Msun star-forming galaxies are rotationally-supported disks for most cosmic epochs (Vmax/sigma{$>$}2-3, z{$<$}5), being dynamically hotter at earlier epochs (z{$>$}1.5). Despite large velocity dispersion at high redshift, cold and dense gas in galaxies predominantly arranges in disky or elongated shapes at all times and masses; these gaseous components exhibit rotationally-dominated motions far exceeding the collisionless stellar bodies.},

  abstract = {We introduce an updated physical model to simulate the formation and evolution of galaxies in cosmological, large-scale gravity+magnetohydrodynamical simulations with the moving mesh code AREPO. The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multi-mode feedback. In this paper we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances which form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content, and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black hole driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics, and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc \$h\^\{-1\}\$)\$\^3\$ cosmological boxes we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of \$10\^\{12\} M\_\{\textbackslash rm sun\}\$ haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low mass end of the galaxy population.},

  abstract = {Producing thousands of simulations of the dark matter distribution in the Universe with increasing precision is a challenging but critical task to facilitate the exploitation of current and forthcoming cosmological surveys. Many inexpensive substitutes to full \$N\$-body simulations have been proposed, even though they often fail to reproduce the statistics of the smaller, non-linear scales. Among these alternatives, a common approximation is represented by the lognormal distribution, which comes with its own limitations as well, while being extremely fast to compute even for high-resolution density fields. In this work, we train a generative deep learning model, mainly made of convolutional layers, to transform projected lognormal dark matter density fields to more realistic dark matter maps, as obtained from full \$N\$-body simulations. We detail the procedure that we follow to generate highly correlated pairs of lognormal and simulated maps, which we use as our training data, exploiting the information of the Fourier phases. We demonstrate the performance of our model comparing various statistical tests with different field resolutions, redshifts and cosmological parameters, proving its robustness and explaining its current limitations. When evaluated on 100 test maps, the augmented lognormal random fields reproduce the power spectrum up to wavenumbers of \$1 \textbackslash{} h \textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, and the bispectrum within 10\%, and always within the error bars, of the fiducial target simulations. Finally, we describe how we plan to integrate our proposed model with existing tools to yield more accurate spherical random fields for weak lensing analysis.},

  abstract = {We analyse the               Planck               full-mission cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and               E               -mode polarization maps to obtain constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). We compare estimates obtained from separable template-fitting, binned, and optimal modal bispectrum estimators, finding consistent values for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes. Our combined temperature and polarization analysis produces the following final results:               f               NL               local               = -0.9 {$\pm$} 5.1;               f               NL               equil               = -26 {$\pm$} 47; and               f               NL               ortho               = -38 {$\pm$} 24 (68\% CL, statistical). These results include low-multipole (4\;{$\leq$}\;               {$\mathscr{l}$}               \;{$<$} \;40) polarization data that are not included in our previous analysis. The results also pass an extensive battery of tests (with additional tests regarding foreground residuals compared to 2015), and they are stable with respect to our 2015 measurements (with small fluctuations, at the level of a fraction of a standard deviation, which is consistent with changes in data processing). Polarization-only bispectra display a significant improvement in robustness; they can now be used independently to set primordial NG constraints with a sensitivity comparable to WMAP temperature-based results and they give excellent agreement. In addition to the analysis of the standard local, equilateral, and orthogonal bispectrum shapes, we consider a large number of additional cases, such as scale-dependent feature and resonance bispectra, isocurvature primordial NG, and parity-breaking models, where we also place tight constraints but do not detect any signal. The non-primordial lensing bispectrum is, however, detected with an improved significance compared to 2015, excluding the null hypothesis at 3.5               {$\sigma$}               . Beyond estimates of individual shape amplitudes, we also present model-independent reconstructions and analyses of the               Planck               CMB bispectrum. Our final constraint on the local primordial trispectrum shape is               g               NL               local               = (-5.8 {$\pm$} 6.5) \texttimes{} 10               4               (68\% CL, statistical), while constraints for other trispectrum shapes are also determined. Exploiting the tight limits on various bispectrum and trispectrum shapes, we constrain the parameter space of different early-Universe scenarios that generate primordial NG, including general single-field models of inflation, multi-field models (e.g. curvaton models), models of inflation with axion fields producing parity-violation bispectra in the tensor sector, and inflationary models involving vector-like fields with directionally-dependent bispectra. Our results provide a high-precision test for structure-formation scenarios, showing complete agreement with the basic picture of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology regarding the statistics of the initial conditions, with cosmic structures arising from adiabatic, passive, Gaussian, and primordial seed perturbations.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the initial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously tested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from the Planck satellite. Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to be robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequency dependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data, and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma). However, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies. In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed variance of the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to persist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in the low-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any primordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend to arbitrarily small angular scales. Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, which shows a deficit of power on similar scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one shows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillations between odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in the data. Although these analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.},

Furthermore, we explore bright quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with broad emission lines (BELs) redshifted into the spectral range of Gaia's Radial Velocity Spectrograph (RVS). We find that Gaia low-resolution spectra of quasars enable a determination of equivalent widths, continuum variability, and the Baldwin effect. Additionally, it will be feasible to analyze BEL reverberation mapping with Gaia data for a small sample of objects. These quasars should have a high cadence of measurements or higher time lags due to large redshifts, high quasar luminosities, or selected lowionization lines. More than 500 known quasars will also get high-resolution spectra of individual BELs in the small wavelength range of the RVS. This allows an investigation of broad emission line shapes and their variabilities to get information on the spatial structure and kinematics of the broad line region. We identify six known variable SDSS quasars with BELs in the RVS that have interesting spectra for a potential intrinsic line variability investigation. However, the signal-to-noise ratio of the RVS is too small for studying narrow and broad absorption lines in quasar spectra.},

  abstract = {In the upcoming decade large astronomical surveys will discover millions of transients raising unprecedented data challenges in the process. Only the use of the machine learning algorithms can process such large data volumes. Most of the discovered transients will belong to the known classes of astronomical objects. However, it is expected that some transients will be rare or completely new events of unknown physical nature. The task of finding them can be framed as an anomaly detection problem. In this work, we perform for the first time an automated anomaly detection analysis in the photometric data of the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), which serves as a proof of concept for the applicability of these methods to future large scale surveys. The analysis consists of the following steps: 1) data selection from the OSC and approximation of the pre-processed data with Gaussian processes, 2) dimensionality reduction, 3) searching for outliers with the use of the isolation forest algorithm, 4) expert analysis of the identified outliers. The pipeline returned 81 candidate anomalies, 27 (33\%) of which were confirmed to be from astrophysically peculiar objects. Found anomalies correspond to a selected sample of 1.4\% of the initial automatically identified data sample of {$\sim$}2000 objects. Among the identified outliers we recognised superluminous supernovae, non-classical Type Ia supernovae, unusual Type II supernovae, one active galactic nucleus and one binary microlensing event. We also found that 16 anomalies classified as supernovae in the literature are likely to be quasars or stars. Our proposed pipeline represents an effective strategy to guarantee we shall not overlook exciting new science hidden in the data we fought so hard to acquire.

We calibrate our nonlinear evolution scheme to the CDM subhalo mass function in the Aquarius N-body simulation, producing a subhalo mass function within the range of simulations. We find tidal effects to be the dominant mechanism of nonlinear evolution in the subhalo population. Finally, we compute the subhalo mass function for \$m\_\textbackslash chi=1.5\$ keV WDM including the effects of nonlinear evolution, and compare radial number densities and mass density profiles of subhalos in CDM and WDM models. We show that all three signatures differ between the two dark matter models, suggesting that probes of substructure may be able to differentiate between them.},

We examine the population of galactic rotation curves measured by SPARC and fit them to dark matter haloes that are distorted with a multipole density distribution, finding a significantly better fit with prolate haloes over spherically symmetric ones. This is to be expected since the long-distance Rubin flattening v(r)= constant is the natural Kepler law due to a filamentary rather than a spherical source. Then, elongating the distribution brings about a smaller squared chi, all other things being equal, including the use of several different radial dark matter profiles. The ellipticities that we fit to rotation curve data seem to be much more significant than those computed in cosmological simulations of dark matter haloes. If the Milky Way's halo would be typical of the spiral-galaxy SPARC sample (which we presently ignore), the local dark matter density might currently be overestimated by a factor 2. This would carry on into dark-matter cross-section bounds.},

As a first step towards a fully predictive theory, we investigate the effect of non-radiative hydrodynamics on the structure of galaxy groups sized halos, which contribute the most to the weak lensing power spectrum. We perform high resolution (more than one million particles per halo and one kilo-parsec resolution) non-radiative hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of a sample of 16 halos, comparing the profiles to popular analytical models. We find that the total mass profile is well fitted by a Navarro, Frenk \& White model, with parameters slightly modified from the dark matter only simulation. We also find that the Komatsu \& Seljak hydrostatic solution provides a good fit to the gas profiles, with however significant deviations, arising from strong turbulent mixing in the core and from non-thermal, turbulent pressure support in the outskirts. The turbulent energy follows a shallow, rising linear profile with radius, and correlates with the halo formation time. Using only three main structural halo parameters as variables (total mass, concentration parameter and central gas density), we can predict with an accuracy better than 20\% the individual gas density and temperature profiles. For the average total mass profile, which is relevant for power spectrum calculations, we even reach an accuracy of 1\%. The robustness of these predictions has been tested against resolution effects, different types of initial conditions and hydrodynamical schemes.},

Characterising a halo's local web environment by its tidal anisotropy \$\textbackslash alpha\$ at scales \$\textbackslash sim4\$ x the halo radius, we demonstrate that these multi-scale correlations represent two distinct statistical links: one between the internal property and \$\textbackslash alpha\$, and the other between \$\textbackslash alpha\$ and large-scale ( \${$>$}30h\^\{-1\}\$Mpc) halo bias \$b\_1\$. We focus on scalar internal properties of haloes related to formation time (concentration \$c\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$), shape (mass ellipsoid asphericity \$c/a\$), velocity dispersion structure (velocity ellipsoid asphericity \$c\_v/a\_v\$ and velocity anisotropy \$\textbackslash beta\$) and angular momentum (dimensionless spin \$\textbackslash lambda\$) in the mass range \$8\textbackslash times10\^\{11\}{$<$} M\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}/(h\^\{-1\}M\_\textbackslash odot){$<$}5\textbackslash times10\^\{14\}\$.

  abstract = {We present a large-scale Bayesian inference framework to constrain cosmological parameters using galaxy redshift surveys, via an application of the Alcock-Paczy\textasciiacute nskiPaczy\textasciiacute nski (AP) test. Our physical model of the non-linearly evolved density field, as probed by galaxy surveys, employs Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) to connect Gaussian initial conditions to the final density field, followed by a coordinate transformation to obtain the redshift space representation for comparison with data. We have implemented a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to generate realisations of three-dimensional (3D) primordial and present-day matter fluctuations from a non-Gaussian LPT-Poissonian density posterior given a set of observations. This hierarchical approach encodes a novel AP test, extracting several orders of magnitude more information from the cosmic expansion compared to classical approaches, to infer cosmological parameters and jointly reconstruct the underlying 3D dark matter density field. The novelty of this AP test lies in constraining the comoving-redshift transformation to infer the appropriate cosmology which yields isotropic correlations of the galaxy density field, with the underlying assumption relying purely on the geometrical symmetries of the cosmological principle. Such an AP test does not rely explicitly on modelling the full statistics of the field. We verified in depth via simulations that this renders our test robust to model misspecification. This leads to another crucial advantage, namely that the cosmological parameters exhibit extremely weak dependence on the currently unresolved phenomenon of galaxy bias, thereby circumventing a potentially key limitation. This is consequently among the first methods to extract a large fraction of information from statistics other than that of direct density contrast correlations, without being sensitive to the amplitude of density fluctuations. We perform several statistical efficiency and consistency tests on a mock galaxy catalogue, using the SDSS-III survey as template, taking into account the survey geometry and selection effects, to validate the Bayesian inference machinery implemented.},

  abstract = {We provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the local Universe, identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and dark matter halos and their constituent substructures in the {$\Lambda$}CDM model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We associate galaxies with dark matter halos and subhalos using subhalo abundance matching, and perform a comprehensive analysis which investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) how much scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. We find that an abundance matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of 0.20 {$\pm$} 0.03 dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. This confirms the theoretical expectation that the stellar mass of galaxies is tightly correlated with the potential wells of their dark matter halos before they are impacted by larger structures. The data put tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass and on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and rule out several alternative abundance matching models that have been considered. This will yield important constraints for galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that the galaxy-halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark Universe.},

A standard halo occupation distribution model evaluated near the best fit Planck {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology provides a good fit to the observed anisotropic clustering, and implies a normalization for the peculiar velocity field of M {$\sim$} 2 \texttimes{} 10 13 h -1 M halos of f {$\sigma$} 8 (z = 0.57) = 0.450 {$\pm$} 0.011. Since this constraint includes both quasi-linear and non-linear scales, it should severely constrain modified gravity models that enhance pairwise infall velocities on these scales. Though model dependent, our measurement represents a factor of 2.5 improvement in precision over the analysis of DR11 on large scales, f {$\sigma$} 8 (z = 0.57) = 0.447 {$\pm$} 0.028, and is the tightest single constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure to date. Our measurement is consistent with the Planck {$\Lambda$}CDM prediction of 0.480 {$\pm$} 0.010 at the {$\sim$} 1.9{$\sigma$} level. Assuming a halo mass function evaluated at the best fit Planck cosmology, we also find that 10\% of CMASS galaxies are satellites in halos of mass M {$\sim$} 6 \texttimes{} 10 13 h -1 M. While none of our tests and model generalizations indicate systematic errors due to an insufficiently detailed model of the galaxy-halo connection, the precision of these first results warrant further investigation into the modeling uncertainties and degeneracies with cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {The nature of the dark energy thought to be causing the accelerating expansion of the Universe is one of the most compelling questions in all of science. Any of the explanations for the accelerated expansion, whether a new field, a negative pressure fluid, or a modification to General Relativity will signal new physics and have a profound effect on our understanding of the Universe. The current observational constraints on dark energy and modifications to gravity still allow for a large range of models and theoretical explanations. Given the importance of dark energy, we must attack the problem from a variety of angles, taking advantage of cross-correlations between and joint analyses of different probes, missions, wavelengths, and surveys, to enable the most stringent cosmological constraints. Dark energy has two observational consequences. The first is an accelerated expansion history as encoded in the redshift-distance relationship. This is indeed the way that dark energy was discovered in the 1990s. Of the primary observational probes of dark energy, Type Ia Supernovae and the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) signal in large scale structure are best suited to measure the expansion history of the Universe [1]. The second effect of dark energy is that the growth of large-scale structure is inhibited as the attractive force of gravity works against the repulsive nature of dark energy. Weak gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters, and redshift space distortions (RSD) are all well-suited for measuring the growth of structure [2]. The theme of this paper is that combining these probes allows for more accurate (less contaminated by systematics) and more precise (statistically since there is information in the cross-correlations) measurements of dark energy. We explore ways in which disparate surveys can significantly enhance our knowledge of dark energy and our ability to control systematics and other errors. We also present arguments for inter-agency cooperation to fully empower the community to make use of the data that will be available in the coming decades. We present a mix of work in progress and suggestions for future scientific efforts. The paper is organized as follows. In \textsection 2, we describe the general framework of cross-correlation measurements and the basic information provided by each probe of dark energy. We then (\textsection 3) describe the ways in which the multiple dark energy probes provided by imaging-based (also referred to as "photometric") dark energy experiments are correlated, and how these correlations may be profitably exploited. Then, in \textsection 4, we explore new opportunities for cross-correlation studies that are possible when information from spectroscopic and imaging experiments are},

  abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most promising cosmological probes of the late universe. Several large ongoing (DES, KiDS, HSC) and planned (LSST, EUCLID, WFIRST) astronomical surveys attempt to collect even deeper and larger scale data on weak lensing. Due to gravitational collapse, the distribution of dark matter is non-Gaussian on small scales. However, observations are typically evaluated through the two-point correlation function of galaxy shear, which does not capture non-Gaussian features of the lensing maps. Previous studies attempted to extract non-Gaussian information from weak lensing observations through several higher-order statistics such as the three-point correlation function, peak counts or Minkowski-functionals. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) emerged in the field of computer vision with tremendous success, and they offer a new and very promising framework to extract information from 2 or 3-dimensional astronomical data sets, confirmed by recent studies on weak lensing. We show that a CNN is able to yield significantly stricter constraints of ({$\sigma$} 8 , {$\Omega$} m) cosmological parameters than the power spectrum using convergence maps generated by full N-body simulations and ray-tracing, at angular scales and shape noise levels relevant for future observations. In a scenario mimicking LSST or Euclid, the CNN yields 2.4-2.8 times smaller credible contours than the power spectrum, and 3.5-4.2 times smaller at noise levels corresponding to a deep space survey such as WFIRST. We also show that at shape noise levels achievable in future space surveys the CNN yields 1.4-2.1 times smaller contours than peak counts, a higher-order statistic capable of extracting non-Gaussian information from weak lensing maps.},

The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\% to 15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {$<$} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {$>$} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q\_0 {$<$}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {$>$}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda{$>$}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega\_M+Omega\_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {$>$}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega\_Lambda=0 and q\_0 {$>$} 0.},

  abstract = {Introduction and Background: Three of the key assumptions that drive most interpretations of crater populations are: (1) Craters form stochastically around a derivable time-dependent function, (2) craters form randomly across a surface, and (3) the population has not reached equilibrium. Two main types of process undermine these assumptions: secondary cratering and crater saturation. Secondary cratering occurs when the ejecta blocks launched from a primary impact event return to strike the planetary surface with enough energy to create their own craters ("secondary craters" because the event is secondary to the initial, or "prima-ry," impact event). These occur in a geologic instant and are not distributed randomly across the surface, in direct conflict with the first two assumptions. Crater saturation occurs when so many craters have formed that no new craters can form without an equal fraction of old ones being erased [e.g., 1]. This results in a crater population with a distribution that does not change its characteristics in time and space, in direct conflict with the third assumption. There are significant ongoing discussions as to the magnitude of the effect of secondary cratering and crater saturation on these three important assumptions, though that discussion is a separate issue from this abstract. In this abstract, we outline the spatial statistic approaches used to identify these two different processes affecting populations of craters and in our talk, we will discuss potential improvements on these and the use of other techniques. Secondary Crater Identification from Spatial Statistics: There are numerous morphologic techniques to identify secondary impact craters [e.g., 2-6], but they are not entirely reliable, for secondaries will often look like primaries and hence cannot be distinguished based on morphologic criteria alone. Therefore , statistical methods are also frequently employed. There are three methods typically used in crater studies to examine the likelihood of contamination by non-morphologically-obvious secondary craters, some more rigorous than others. First is a simple spatial density comparison: A region that is thought to represent a single, random population is subdivided into 2 or more parts and the crater populations are compared. If the size-frequency distributions (SFDs) of each are similar to within the specified uncertainties, they are assumed to, at worst, have the same level of secondary crater contamination and, at best, no contamination. This is simple to implement but is poor in specificity. The second method is to examine the crater SFD structure itself. Secondary craters typically have a steeper SFD than primary craters; while primaries of},

The median number of field-of-view transits in the three photometric bands is between 40 and 44 measurements per source and covers 34 months of data collection. We pursue a classification of Galactic and extra-galactic objects that are detected as variable by Gaia across the whole sky. Supervised machine learning (eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest) was employed to generate multi-class, binary, and meta-classifiers that classified variable objects with photometric time series in the G, BP, and RP bands. Classification results comprise 12.4 million sources (selected from a much larger set of potential variable objects) and include about 9 million variable stars classified into 22 variability types in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds and Andromeda, plus thousands of supernova explosions in distant galaxies, 1 million active galactic nuclei, and almost 2.5 million galaxies. The identification of galaxies was made possible by the artificial variability of extended objects as detected by Gaia, so they were published in the galaxy\_candidates table of the Gaia DR3 archive, separate from the classifications of genuine variability (in the vari\_classifier\_result table). The latter contains 24 variability classes or class groups of periodic and non-periodic variables (pulsating, eclipsing, rotating, eruptive, cataclysmic, stochastic, and microlensing), with amplitudes from a few milli-magnitudes to several magnitudes.},

We use weak gravitational lensing from the Canada-France Imaging Survey (CFIS) component of the Ultraviolet-Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) to measure the ellipticity of the dark matter haloes around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (DR7) and from the CMASS and LOWZ samples of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), assuming their major axes are aligned with the stellar light. We find that DR7 LRGs with masses \$M \textbackslash sim 2.5\textbackslash times10\^\{13\} \textbackslash textrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}/h\$ have halo ellipticities \$e=0.35\textbackslash pm0.09\$. Expressed as a fraction of the galaxy ellipticity, we find \$f\_h = 1.4\textbackslash pm0.4\$. For BOSS LRGs, the detection is of marginal significance: \$e = 0.17\textbackslash pm0.10\$ and \$f\_h=0.1\textbackslash pm0.4\$. These results are in agreement with other measurements of halo ellipticity from weak lensing and, taken together with previous results, suggest an increase of halo ellipticity of \$0.10\textbackslash pm0.05\$ per decade in halo mass. This trend agrees with the predictions from hydrodynamical simulations, which find that at higher halo masses, not only do dark matter haloes become more elliptical, but that the misalignment between major axis of the stellar light in the central galaxy and that of the dark matter decreases.},

  abstract = {The relationship between galaxies and haloes is central to the description of galaxy formation, and a fundamental step towards extracting precise cosmological information from galaxy maps. However, this connection involves several complex processes that are interconnected. Machine Learning methods are flexible tools that can learn complex correlations between a large number of features, but are traditionally designed as deterministic estimators. In this work, we use the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation and apply neural networks in a binning classification scheme to predict probability distributions of central galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, colour, specific star formation rate, and radius, using as input features the halo mass, concentration, spin, age, and the overdensity on a scale of 3 \$h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc. The model captures the intrinsic scatter in the relation between halo and galaxy properties, and can thus be used to quantify the uncertainties related to the stochasticity of the galaxy properties with respect to the halo properties. In particular, with our proposed method, one can define and accurately reproduce the properties of the different galaxy populations in great detail. We demonstrate the power of this tool by directly comparing traditional single-point estimators and the predicted joint probability distributions, and also by computing the power spectrum of a large number of tracers defined on the basis of the predicted colour-stellar mass diagram. We show that the neural networks reproduce clustering statistics of the individual galaxy populations with excellent precision and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Dark matter in the universe evolves through gravity to form a complex network of halos, filaments, sheets and voids, that is known as the cosmic web. Computational models of the underlying physical processes, such as classical N-body simulations, are extremely resource intensive, as they track the action of gravity in an expanding universe using billions of particles as tracers of the cosmic matter distribution. Therefore, upcoming cosmology experiments will face a computational bottleneck that may limit the exploitation of their full scientific potential. To address this challenge, we demonstrate the application of a machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to learn models that can efficiently generate new, physically realistic realizations of the cosmic web. Our training set is a small, representative sample of 2D image snapshots from N-body simulations of size 500 and 100 Mpc. We show that the GAN-generated samples are qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to the originals. For the larger boxes of size 500 Mpc, it is very difficult to distinguish them visually. The agreement of the power spectrum \$P\_\{k\}\$ P k is 1\textendash 2\% for most of the range, between \$k=0.06\$ k = 0.06 and \$k=0.4\$ k = 0.4 . For the remaining values of k , the agreement is within 15\%, with the error rate increasing for \$k{$>$}0.8\$ k {$>$} 0.8 . For smaller boxes of size 100 Mpc, we find that the visual agreement to be good, but some differences are noticable. The error on the power spectrum is of the order of 20\%. We attribute this loss of performance to the fact that the matter distribution in 100 Mpc cutouts was very inhomogeneous between images, a situation in which the performance of GANs is known to deteriorate. We find a good match for the correlation matrix of full \$P\_\{k\}\$ P k range for 100 Mpc data and of small scales for 500 Mpc, with {$\sim$}20\% disagreement for large scales. An important advantage of generating cosmic web realizations with a GAN is the considerable gains in terms of computation time. Each new sample generated by a GAN takes a fraction of a second, compared to the many hours needed by traditional N-body techniques. We anticipate that the use of generative models such as GANs will therefore play an important role in providing extremely fast and precise simulations of cosmic web in the era of large cosmological surveys, such as Euclid and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).},

  abstract = {We analyze the density field of 264,283 galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and included in the SDSS data release nine (DR9). In total, the SDSS DR9 BOSS data includes spectroscopic redshifts for over 400,000 galaxies spread over a footprint of more than 3,000 deg\^2. We measure the power spectrum of these galaxies with redshifts 0.43 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7 in order to constrain the amount of local non-Gaussianity, f\_NL,local, in the primordial density field, paying particular attention to the impact of systematic uncertainties. The BOSS galaxy density field is systematically affected by the local stellar density and this influences the ability to accurately measure f\_NL,local. In the absence of any correction, we find (erroneously) that the probability that f\_NL,local is greater than zero, P(f\_NL,local {$>$}0), is 99.5\%. After quantifying and correcting for the systematic bias and including the added uncertainty, we find -45 {$<$} f\_NL,local {$<$} 195 at 95\% confidence, and P(f\_NL,local {$>$}0) = 91.0\%. A more conservative approach assumes that we have only learned the k-dependence of the systematic bias and allows any amplitude for the systematic correction; we find that the systematic effect is not fully degenerate with that of f\_NL,local, and we determine that -82 {$<$} f\_NL,local {$<$} 178 (at 95\% confidence) and P(f\_NL,local {$>$}0) = 68\%. This analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the impact of Galactic foregrounds on f\_NL,local measurements. We outline the methods that account for these systematic biases and uncertainties. We expect our methods to yield robust constraints on f\_NL,local for both our own and future large-scale-structure investigations.},

  abstract = {We present large-scale structure catalogues from the completed extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). Derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV Data Release 16 (DR16), these catalogues provide the data samples, corrected for observational systematics, and random positions sampling the survey selection function. Combined, they allow large-scale clustering measurements suitable for testing cosmological models. We describe the methods used to create these catalogues for the eBOSS DR16 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Quasar samples. The quasar catalogue contains 343 708 redshifts with 0.8 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2 over 4808 deg2. We combine 174 816 eBOSS LRG redshifts over 4242 deg2 in the redshift interval 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.0 with SDSS-III BOSS LRGs in the same redshift range to produce a combined sample of 377 458 galaxy redshifts distributed over 9493 deg2. Improved algorithms for estimating redshifts allow that 98 per cent of LRG observations result in a successful redshift, with less than one per cent catastrophic failures ( z {$>$} 1000 km s-1). For quasars, these rates are 95 and 2 per cent (with z {$>$} 3000 km s-1). We apply corrections for trends between the number densities of our samples and the properties of the imaging and spectroscopic data. For example, the quasar catalogue obtains a {$\chi$} 2/DoF = 776/10 for a null test against imaging depth before corrections and a {$\chi$} 2/DoF= 6/8 after. The catalogues, combined with careful consideration of the details of their construction found here-in, allow companion papers to present cosmological results with negligible impact from observational systematic uncertainties.},

  abstract = {We determine an optimized clustering statistic to be used for galaxy samples with significant redshift uncertainty, such as those that rely on photometric redshifts. To do so, we study the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) information content as a function of the orientation of galaxy clustering modes with respect to their angle to the line-of-sight (LOS). The clustering along the LOS, as observed in a redshift-space with significant redshift uncertainty, has contributions from clustering modes with a range of orientations with respect to the true LOS. For redshift uncertainty {$\sigma$} z 0.02(1 + z) we find that while the BAO information is confined to transverse clustering modes in the true space, it is spread nearly evenly in the observed space. Thus, measuring clustering in terms of the projected separation (regardless of the LOS) is an efficient and nearly lossless compression of the signal for {$\sigma$} z 0.02(1 + z). For reduced redshift uncertainty, a more careful consideration is required. We then use more than 1700 realizations (combining two separate sets) of galaxy simulations mimicking the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 sample to validate our analytic results and optimized analysis procedure. We find that using the correlation function binned in projected separation, we can achieve uncertainties that are within 10 per cent of those predicted by Fisher matrix forecasts. We predict that DES Y1 should achieve a 5 per cent distance measurement using our optimized methods. We expect the results presented here to be important for any future BAO measurements made using photometric redshift data.},

Utilizing over 112,778 BOSS spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshift catalog for the galaxies in the SDSS DR8 imaging area that, after masking, covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). We investigate fluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function of Galactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass, photometric offset, and North/South Galactic hemisphere. We find that the presence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are not traditionally masked) effectively remove area. Failing to correct for such stars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlation function, w(\texttheta ), that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. We describe how one can effectively mask for the presence of the 2 A. J. Ross et al. stars, without removing any galaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. Additionally, we apply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errors imparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. We find that failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces a systematic error on w(\texttheta ). We measure w(\texttheta ), in four z phot slices of width 0.05 between 0.45 {$<$} z phot {$<$} 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correcting for the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generally consistent with a generic {$\Lambda$}CDM model, at scales up to 60 o. At scales greater than 3 o and z phot {$>$} 0.5, the magnitude of the corrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w(\texttheta ).

DR9 includes spectroscopic redshifts for over 400,000 galaxies spread over a footprint of 3,275 deg 2. We identify, characterize, and mitigate the impact of sources of systematic uncertainty on large-scale clustering measurements, both for angular moments of the redshift-space correlation function, {$\xi$} (s) and the spherically averaged power spectrum, P (k), in order 2 A. J. Ross et al. to ensure that robust cosmological constraints will be obtained from these data. A correlation between the projected density of stars and the higher redshift (0.43 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7) galaxy sample (the 'CMASS' sample) due to imaging systematics imparts a systematic error that is larger than the statistical error of the clustering measurements at scales s {$>$} 120h -1 Mpc or k {$<$} 0.01hMpc -1. We find that these errors can be ameliorated by weighting galaxies based on their surface brightness and the local stellar density. The clustering of CMASS galaxies found in the Northern and Southern Galactic footprints of the survey generally agrees to within 2{$\sigma$}. We use mock galaxy catalogs that simulate the CMASS selection function to determine that randomly selecting galaxy redshifts in order to simulate the radial selection function of a random sample imparts the least systematic error on {$\xi$} (s) measurements and that this systematic error is negligible for the spherically averaged correlation function, {$\xi$} 0. We find a peak in {$\xi$} 0 at s {$\sim$} 200h -1 Mpc, with a corresponding feature with period {$\sim$} 0.03hMpc -1 in P (k), and find features at least as strong in 4.8\% of the mock galaxy catalogs, concluding this feature is likely to be a consequence of cosmic variance. The methods we recommend for the calculation of clustering measurements using the CMASS sample are adopted in companion papers that locate the position of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature (Anderson et al. 2012), constrain cosmological models using the full shape of {$\xi$} 0 (Sanchez et al. 2012), and measure the rate of structure growth (Reid et al. 2012).},

For surveys covering a large redshift range we can no longer ignore cosmological evolution, meaning that either the redshift shells analysed have to be significantly narrower than the survey, or we have to allow for the averaging over evolving quantities. Both of these have the potential to remove signal: analysing small volumes increases the size of the Fourier window function, reducing the large-scale information, while averaging over evolving quantities can, if not performed carefully, remove differential information. It will be important to measure cosmological evolution from these surveys to explore and discriminate between models. We apply a method to optimally extract this differential information to mock catalogues designed to mimic the eBOSS quasar sample. By applying a set of weights to extract redshift space distortion measurements as a function of redshift, we demonstrate an analysis that does not invoke the problems discussed above. We show that our estimator gives unbiased constraints.},

  abstract = {Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) represent one of the cleanest probes of dark energy, allowing for tests of the cosmological model through the measurement of distance and expansion rate from a 3D galaxy distribution. The signal appears at large scales in the correlation function where linear theory applies, allowing for the construction of accurate models. However, due to the lower number of modes available at these scales, sample variance has a significant impact on the signal, and may sharpen or widen the underlying peak. Therefore, equivalent mock realizations of a galaxy survey present different errors in the position of the peak when uncertainties are estimated from the posterior probability distribution corresponding to the individual mocks. Hence the posterior width, often quoted as the error in BAO survey measurements, is subject to sample noise. A different definition of the error is provided by the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator, which involves the average over multiple realizations, and is not subject to sample noise. In this work we re-analyse the main galaxy survey data available for BAO measurements and quantify the impact of the noise component on the error quoted for BAO measurements. We quantify the difference between three definitions of the error: the confidence region computed from a single posterior, the average of the variances of many realizations, and the Fisher matrix prediction assuming a Gaussian likelihood.},

Making viable cosmological inferences based on these observations requires accurate theoretical modeling of the mildly nonlinear regime. In this work we investigate the sensitivity of cosmological parameter measurements from future probes of galaxy clustering to the choice of nonlinear prescription up to \$k\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}=0.3\textasciitilde h\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. In particular, we calculate the induced parameter bias when the mildly nonlinear regime is modeled by the Halofit fitting scheme. We find significant (\$\textbackslash sim5\textbackslash sigma\$) bias for some parameters with a future Euclid-like survey. We also explore the contribution of different scales to the parameter estimation for different observational setups and cosmological scenarios, compared for the two nonlinear prescriptions of Halofit and EFTofLSS. We include in the analysis the free parameters of the nonlinear theory and a blind parametrization for the galaxy bias. We find that marginalization over these nuisance parameters significantly boosts the errors of the standard cosmological parameters. This renders the differences in the predictions of the various nonlinear prescriptions less effective when transferred to the parameter space. More accurate modeling of these nuisance parameters would therefore greatly enhance the cosmological gain from the mildly nonlinear regime.},

Our results show no significant evidence for a deviation from the standard {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter model. The combination of the information from our clustering measurements with recent data from the cosmic microwave background is sufficient to constrain the curvature of the Universe to {$\Omega$}k = 0.0010 {$\pm$} 0.0029, the total neutrino mass to {$\sum$}m{$\nu$} {$<$} 0.23 eV (95 per cent confidence level), the effective number of relativistic species to Neff = 3.31 {$\pm$} 0.27 and the dark energy equation of state to wDE = -1.051 {$\pm$} 0.076. These limits are further improved by adding information from Type Ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations from other samples. In particular, this data set combination is completely consistent with a time-independent dark energy equation of state, in which case we find wDE = -1.024 {$\pm$} 0.052. We explore the constraints on the growth rate of cosmic structures assuming f(z) = {$\Omega$}m(z){$\gamma$} and obtain {$\gamma$} = 0.69 {$\pm$} 0.15, consistent with the predictions of general relativity of {$\gamma$} = 0.55. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {Studies of large-scale structures in the Universe, such as superstructures or cosmic voids, have been widely used to characterize the properties of the cosmic web through statistical analyses. On the other hand, the 2-point correlation function of large-scale tracers such as galaxies or halos provides a reliable statistical measure. However, this function applies to the spatial distribution of point-like objects, and therefore it is not appropriate for extended large structures which strongly depart from spherical symmetry. Here we present an analysis based on the standard correlation function formalism that can be applied to extended objects exhibiting arbitrary shapes. Following this approach, we compute the probability excess {$\Xi$} of having spheres sharing parts of cosmic structures with respect to a realization corresponding to a distribution of the same structures in random positions. For this aim, we identify superstructures defined as Future Virialized Structures (FVSs) in semi-anaytic galaxies on the MPDL2 MultiDark simulation. We have also identified cosmic voids to provide a joint study of their relative distribution with respect to the superstructures. Our analysis suggests that {$\Xi$} provides useful characterizations of the large scale distribution, as suggested from an analysis of subsets of the simulation. Even when superstructure properties may exhibit negligible variations across the subsets , {$\Xi$} has the sensitivity to statistically distinguish sub-boxes that departs from the mean at larger scales. Thus, our methods can be applied in analysis of future surveys to provide characterizations of large-scale structure suitable to distinguish different theoretical scenarios.},

We show how the convolved multipole power spectrum is related to the original power spectrum, using the multipole moments of the window function. Second, we investigate the deconvolved power spectrum, which is obtained by using the Fourier deconvolution theorem. In the second approach, we measure the multipole power spectrum deconvolved from the window effect.

In addition, whereas existing methods are limited to equivariance on 3 dimensional spaces, our model is easily scaled to higher-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on dynamical systems modelling, representation learning in graph autoencoders and predicting molecular properties.},

The BOSS-DR12 dataset includes 1,198,006 massive galaxies spread over the redshift range 0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.75. These galaxy samples are categorized in three redshift bins. Using CLPT-GSRSD in our analysis of the combined sample of the three redshift bins, we report measurements of f {$\sigma$} 8 for the three redshift bins. We find f {$\sigma$} 8 = 0.430 {$\pm$} 0.054 at z eff = 0.38, f {$\sigma$} 8 = 0.452 {$\pm$} 0.057 at z eff = 0.51 and f {$\sigma$} 8 = 0.457 {$\pm$} 0.052 at z eff = 0.61. Our results are consistent with the predictions of Planck {$\Lambda$}CDM-GR. Our constraints on the growth rates of structure in the Universe at different redshifts serve as a useful probe, which can help distinguish between a model of the Universe based on dark energy and models based on modified theories of gravity. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in Alam et al.

  abstract = {The scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off the free-electron gas in galaxies and clusters leaves detectable imprints on high resolution CMB maps: the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects (tSZ and kSZ respectively). We use combined microwave maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR5 and Planck in combination with the CMASS and LOWZ galaxy catalogs from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR10 and DR12), to study the gas associated with these galaxy groups. Using individual reconstructed velocities, we perform a stacking analysis and reject the no-kSZ hypothesis at 6.5\$\textbackslash sigma\$, the highest significance to date. This directly translates into a measurement of the electron number density profile, and thus of the gas density profile. Despite the limited signal to noise, the measurement shows at high significance that the gas density profile is more extended than the dark matter density profile, for any reasonable baryon abundance (formally \${$>$}90\textbackslash sigma\$ for the cosmic baryon abundance). We simultaneously measure the tSZ signal, i.e. the electron thermal pressure profile of the same CMASS objects, and reject the no-tSZ hypothesis at 10\$\textbackslash sigma\$. We combine tSZ and kSZ measurements to estimate the electron temperature to 20\% precision in several aperture bins, and find it comparable to the virial temperature. In a companion paper, we analyze these measurements to constrain the gas thermodynamics and the properties of feedback inside galaxy groups. We present the corresponding LOWZ measurements in this paper, ruling out a null kSZ (tSZ) signal at 2.9 (13.9)\$\textbackslash sigma\$, and leave their interpretation to future work. Our stacking software ThumbStack is publicly available at https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/ThumbStack and directly applicable to future Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 data.},

In this work we predict high resolution dark matter halos from large scale, low resolution dark matter only simulations. This is achieved by mapping lower resolution to higher resolution density fields of simulations sharing the same cosmology, initial conditions and box-sizes. To resolve structure down to a factor of 8 increase in mass resolution, we use a variation of U-Net with a conditional GAN, generating output that visually and statistically matches the high resolution target extremely well. This suggests that our method can be used to create high resolution density output over Gpc/h box-sizes from low resolution simulations with negligible computational effort.},

The unWISE Catalog has two advantages over the existing WISE catalog (AllWISE): first, it is based on significantly deeper imaging, and second, it features improved modeling of crowded regions. The deeper imaging used in the unWISE Catalog comes from the coaddition of all publicly available 3\$-\$5 micron WISE imaging, including that from the ongoing NEOWISE-Reactivation mission, thereby increasing the total exposure time by a factor of 5 relative to AllWISE. At these depths, even at high Galactic latitudes many sources are blended with their neighbors; accordingly, the unWISE analysis simultaneously fits thousands of sources to obtain accurate photometry. Our new catalog detects sources at 5-sigma roughly 0.7 magnitudes fainter than the AllWISE catalog and more accurately models millions of faint sources in the Galactic plane, enabling a wealth of Galactic and extragalactic science. In particular, relative to AllWISE, unWISE doubles the number of galaxies detected between redshifts 0 and 1 and triples the number between redshifts 1 and 2, cataloging more than half a billion galaxies over the whole sky.},

Furthermore, not all possibly relevant markers may be known and sufficiently well described a priori to even guide annotation. While supervised learning yields good results if expert labeled training data is available, the visual variability, and thus the vocabulary of findings, we can detect and exploit, is limited to the annotated lesions. Here, we present fast AnoGAN (f-AnoGAN), a generative adversarial network (GAN) based unsupervised learning approach capable of identifying anomalous images and image segments, that can serve as imaging biomarker candidates. We build a generative model of healthy training data, and propose and evaluate a fast mapping technique of new data to the GAN's latent space. The mapping is based on a trained encoder, and anomalies are detected via a combined anomaly score based on the building blocks of the trained model \textendash{} comprising a discriminator feature residual error and an image reconstruction error. In the experiments on optical coherence tomography data, we compare the proposed method with alternative approaches, and provide comprehensive empirical evidence that f-AnoGAN outperforms alternative approaches and yields high anomaly detection accuracy. In addition, a visual Turing test with two retina experts showed that the generated images are indistinguishable from real normal retinal OCT images. The f-AnoGAN code is available at https://github.com/tSchlegl/f-AnoGAN.},

Models are typically based on large amounts of data with annotated examples of known markers aiming at automating detection. High annotation effort and the limitation to a vocabulary of known markers limit the power of such approaches. Here, we perform unsupervised learning to identify anomalies in imaging data as candidates for markers. We propose AnoGAN, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to learn a manifold of normal anatomical variability, accompanying a novel anomaly scoring scheme based on the mapping from image space to a latent space. Applied to new data, the model labels anomalies, and scores image patches indicating their fit into the learned distribution. Results on optical coherence tomography images of the retina demonstrate that the approach correctly identifies anomalous images, such as images containing retinal fluid or hyperreflective foci.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of the triaxial dark matter halo shapes and alignment correlation functions in the Millennium and Millennium-2 dark matter N-body simulations. These two simulations allow us to measure the distributions of halo shapes down to 10\% of the virial radius over a halo mass range of 6E9 - 2E14 M\_sun/h. We largely confirm previous results on the distributions of halo axis ratios as a function of halo mass, but we find that the median angle between halo major axes at different halo radii can vary by a factor of 2 between the Millennium-1 and 2 simulations because of the different mass resolution. Thus, error in the shape determinations from limited resolution is potentially degenerate with the misalignment of halo inner and outer shapes used to constrain Brightest Cluster Galaxy alignments in previous works. We also present simplifying parameterizations for the 3-D halo-mass alignment correlation functions that are necessary ingredients for triaxial halo models of large-scale structure and models of galaxy intrinsic alignments as contaminants for cosmic shear surveys. We measure strong alignments between halos of all masses and the surrounding dark matter overdensities out to several tens of Mpc/h, in agreement with observed shear-galaxy and cluster shape correlations. We use these measurements to forecast the contribution to the weak lensing signal around galaxy clusters from correlated mass along the line-of-sight. For prolate clusters with major axes aligned with the line-of-sight the fraction of the weak lensing signal from mass external to the cluster can be twice that predicted if the excess halo alignment correlation is assumed to be zero.},

  abstract = {Measurements of correlation functions and their comparison with theoretical models are often employed in natural sciences, including astrophysics and cosmology, to determine best-fitting model parameters and their confidence regions. Due to a lack of better descriptions, the likelihood function of the correlation function is often assumed to be a multi-variate Gaussian. Using different methods, we show that correlation functions have to satisfy constraint relations, owing to the non-negativity of the power spectrum of the underlying random process. Specifically, for any statistically homogeneous and (for more than one spatial dimension) isotropic random field with correlation function {$\epsilon$}(x), we derive inequalities for the correlation coefficients rn = {$\epsilon$}(nx)/{$\epsilon$}(0) (for integer n) of the form rnl {$\leq$} rn {$\leq$} rnu, where the lower and upper bounds on rn depend on the rj, with j {$<$} n, or more explicitly {$\epsilon$}n- \{{$\epsilon$}(0), {$\epsilon$}(x), {$\epsilon$}(2x), . . . , {$\epsilon$}([n - 1]x)\} {$\leq$} {$\epsilon$}(nx) = .n+ \{.(0), .(x), .(2x), . . . , .([n - 1]x)\} . Explicit expressions for the bounds are obtained for arbitrary n.We show that these constraint equations very significantly limit the set of possible correlation functions. For one particular example of a fiducial cosmic shear survey, we show that the Gaussian likelihood ellipsoid has a significant spill-over into the region of correlation functions forbidden by the aforementioned constraints, rendering the resulting best-fitting model parameters and their error region questionable, and indicating the need for a better description of the likelihood function.We conduct some simple numerical experiments which explicitly demonstrate the failure of a Gaussian description for the likelihood of {$\epsilon$}. Instead, the shape of the likelihood function of the correlation coefficients appears to follow approximately the shape of the bounds on the rn, even if the Gaussian ellipsoid lies well within the allowed region. Therefore, we define a non-linear and coupled transformation of the rn, based on these bounds. Some numerical experiments then indicate that a Gaussian is a much better description of the likelihood in these transformed variables than of the original correlation coefficients - in particular, the full probability distribution then lies explicitly in the allowed region. For more than one spatial dimension of the random field, the explicit expressions of the bounds on the rn are not optimal. We outline a geometrical method how tighter bounds may be obtained in principle. We illustrate this method for a few simple cases; a more general treatment awaits future work. \textcopyright{} 2009 ESO.},

  abstract = {Cosmological simulations predict that galaxies are embedded into triaxial dark matter haloes, which appear approximately elliptical in projection. Weak gravitational lensing allows us to constrain these halo shapes and thereby test the nature of dark matter. Weak lensing has already provided robust detections of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scales of groups and clusters, whereas results for galaxies have been somewhat inconclusive. Here we combine data from five weak lensing surveys (NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS, listed in order of most to least constraining) in order to tighten observational constraints on galaxyscale halo ellipticity for photometrically selected lens samples. We constrain fh, the average ratio between the aligned component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity of the light distribution, finding fh = 0.303-+00..008709 for red lens galaxies and fh = 0.217+-00..116509 for blue lens galaxies when assuming elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White density profiles and a linear scaling between halo ellipticity and galaxy ellipticity. Our constraints for red galaxies constitute the currently most significant (3.8{$\sigma$}) systematics-corrected detection of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scale of galaxies. Our results are in good agreement with expectations from the Millennium Simulation that apply the same analysis scheme and incorporate models for galaxy\textendash halo misalignment. Assuming these misalignment models and the analysis assumptions stated above are correct, our measurements imply an average dark matter halo ellipticity for the studied red galaxy samples of | h| = 0.174 {$\pm$} 0.046, where | h| = (1 - q)/(1 + q) relates to the ratio q = b/a of the minor and major axes of the projected mass distribution. Similar measurements based on larger upcoming weak lensing data sets can help to calibrate models for intrinsic galaxy alignments, which constitute an important source of systematic uncertainty in cosmological weak lensing studies.},

  abstract = {The volume of data that will be produced by the next generation of astrophysical instruments represents a significant opportunity for making unplanned and unexpected discoveries. Conversely, finding unexpected objects or phenomena within such large volumes of data presents a challenge that may best be solved using computational and statistical approaches. We present the application of a coarse-grained complexity measure for identifying interesting observations in large astronomical data sets. This measure, which has been termed apparent complexity, has been shown to model human intuition and perceptions of complexity. Apparent complexity is computationally efficient to derive and can be used to segment and identify interesting observations in very large data sets based on their morphological complexity. We show, using data from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey, that apparent complexity can be combined with clustering methods to provide an automated process for distinguishing between images of galaxies which have been classified as having simple and complex morphologies. The approach generalizes well when applied to new data after being calibrated on a smaller data set, where it performs better than tested classification methods using pixel data. This generalizability positions apparent complexity as a suitable machine-learning feature for identifying complex observations with unanticipated features.},

  abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute the non-linear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter haloes, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations between the haloes and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that the concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. The galaxy power spectrum differs from the dark matter power spectrum because the pair-weighted number of galaxies does not scale with the halo mass and because most haloes harbour a central galaxy. If the pair-weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters, then the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with a slope close to the observed over several orders of magnitude in scale. Such a model also predicts a later onset of non-linear clustering in comparison with dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM) models with the data. A generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale-dependent and non-monotonic. This is particularly important for red or elliptical galaxies, which are preferentially found in larger mass haloes and for which the bias in the power spectrum may be scale-dependent even on large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger haloes host more than one galaxy. We compute predictions for the cross-correlation coefficient as a function of scale and discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum.},

Such tests are particularly important for interpreting the surprising highionization ultraviolet (UV) line emission detected at z {$>$} 6 in recent years. We present HST/COS UV spectra of 10 nearby metal-poor star-forming galaxies selected to show He II emission in SDSS optical spectra. The targets span nearly a dex in gas-phase oxygen abundance (7.8 {$<$} 12 + logO/H {$<$} 8.5) and present uniformly large specific star formation rates (sSFR \textasciitilde 102 Gyr-1). The UV spectra confirm that metal-poor stellar populations can power extreme nebular emission in high-ionization UV lines, reaching CIII] equivalent widths comparable to those seen in systems at z \textasciitilde{} 6-7. Our data reveal a marked transition in UV spectral properties with decreasing metallicity, with systems below 12 + logO/H {$\lessequivlnt$} 8.0 (Z/Z{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1/5) presenting minimal stellar wind features and prominent nebular emission in He II and C IV. This is consistent with nearly an order of magnitude increase in ionizing photon production beyond the He+-ionizing edge relative to H-ionizing flux as metallicity decreases below a fifth solar, well in excess of standard stellar population synthesis predictions. Our results suggest that often-neglected sources of energetic radiation such as stripped binary products and very massive O-stars produce a sharper change in the ionizing spectrum with decreasing metallicity than expected. Consequently, nebular emission in C IV and He II powered by these stars may provide useful metallicity constraints in the reionization era.},

The CMB lensing-quasar cross-power spectrum is detected for the first time at a significance of 3.8 sigma, which directly confirms that the quasar distribution traces the mass distribution at high redshifts z{$>$}1. Our detection passes a number of null tests and systematic checks. Using this cross-power spectrum, we measure the amplitude of the linear quasar bias assuming a template for its redshift dependence, and find the amplitude to be consistent with an earlier measurement from clustering; at redshift z \textasciitilde{} 1.4, the peak of the distribution of quasars in our maps, our measurement corresponds to a bias of b = 2.5 +/- 0.6. With the signal-to-noise ratio on CMB lensing measurements likely to improve by an order of magnitude over the next few years, our results demonstrate the potential of CMB lensing cross-correlations to probe astrophysics at high redshifts.},

We present a novel test of this assumption, which uses the statistics of weighted or 'marked' correlations, which prove to be particularly well-suited to detecting and quantifying weak correlations with environment. We find that close pairs of haloes form at slightly higher redshifts than more widely separated halo pairs, suggesting that haloes in dense regions form at slightly earlier times than haloes of the same mass in less dense regions.

  abstract = {Marked statistics allow sensitive tests of how galaxy properties correlate with environment, as well as of how correlations between galaxy properties are affected by environment. A halo-model description of marked correlations is developed, which incorporates the effects which arise from the facts that typical galaxy marks (e.g. luminosity, colour, star formation rate, stellar mass) depend on the mass of the parent halo, and that massive haloes extend to larger radii and populate denser regions. Comparison with measured marked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models shows good agreement on scales smaller than a megaparsec, and excellent agreement on larger scales. The halo-model description shows clearly that the behaviour of some low-order marked statistics on these scales encodes information about the mean galaxy mark as a function of halo mass, but is insensitive to mark gradients within haloes. Higher-order statistics encode information about higher-order moments of the distribution of marks within haloes. This information is obtained without ever having to identify haloes or clusters in the galaxy distribution. On scales smaller than a megaparsec, the halo-model calculation shows that marked statistics allow sensitive tests of whether or not central galaxies in haloes are a special population. A prescription for including more general mark gradients in the halo-model description is also provided. The formalism developed here is particularly well suited to interpretation of marked statistics in astrophysical data sets, because it is phrased in the same language that is currently used to interpret more standard measures of galaxy clustering. \textcopyright{} 2005 RAS.},

This reduces the impact of systematic uncertainties in background modeling while enhancing signal purity, resulting in improved discovery significance relative to existing taggers. The network is trained using an adversarial strategy, resulting in a tagger that learns to balance classification accuracy with decorrelation. As a benchmark scenario, we consider the case where large-radius jets originating from a boosted resonance decay are discriminated from a background of nonresonant quark and gluon jets. We show that in the presence of systematic uncertainties on the background rate, our adversarially-trained, decorrelated tagger considerably outperforms a conventionally trained neural network, despite having a slightly worse signal-background separation power. We generalize the adversarial training technique to include a parametric dependence on the signal hypothesis, training a single network that provides optimized, interpolatable decorrelated jet tagging across a continuous range of hypothetical resonance masses, after training on discrete choices of the signal mass.},

  abstract = {The two-point correlation function (2PCF) is the most widely used tool for quantifying the spatial distribution of galaxies. Since the distribution of galaxies is determined by galaxy formation physics as well as the underlying cosmology, fitting an observed correlation function yields valuable insights into both. The calculation for a 2PCF involves computing pair-wise separations and consequently, the computing time-scales quadratically with the number of galaxies. The next-generation galaxy surveys are slated to observe many millions of galaxies, and computing the 2PCF for such surveys would be prohibitively time-consuming. Additionally, modern modelling techniques require the 2PCF to be calculated thousands of times on simulated galaxy catalogues of at least equal size to the data and would be completely unfeasible for the next-generation surveys. Thus, calculating the 2PCF forms a substantial bottleneck in improving our understanding of the fundamental physics of the Universe, and we need high-performance software to compute the correlation function. In this paper, we present CORRFUNC - a suite of highly optimized, OPENMP parallel clustering codes. The improved performance of CORRFUNC arises from both efficient algorithms as well as software design that suits the underlying hardware of modern CPUs. CORRFUNC can compute a wide range of 2D and 3D correlation functions in either simulation (Cartesian) space or on-sky coordinates. CORRFUNC runs efficiently in both single- and multithreaded modes and can compute a typical two-point projected correlation function [wp(rp)] for {$\sim$}1 million galaxies within a few seconds on a single thread. CORRFUNC is designed to be both user-friendly and fast and is publicly available at https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc.},

A correlation function fundamentally requires computing pair-wise separations between two sets of points and then computing a histogram of the separations. Corrfunc is an existing open-source, high-performance software package for efficiently computing a multitude of correlation functions. In this paper, we will discuss the SIMD AVX512F kernels within Corrfunc, capable of processing 16 floats or 8 doubles at a time. The latest manually implemented Corrfunc AVX512F kernels show a speedup of up to \textasciitilde 4\texttimes{} relative to compiler-generated code for double-precision calculations. The AVX512F kernels show \textasciitilde 1.6\texttimes{} speedup relative to the AVX kernels and compares favorably to a theoretical maximum of 2\texttimes. In addition, by pruning pairs with too large of a minimum possible separation, we achieve a \textasciitilde 5\textendash 10\% speedup across all the SIMD kernels. Such speedups highlight the importance of programming explicitly with SIMD vector intrinsics for complex calculations that can not be efficiently vectorized by compilers.

  abstract = {We present measurements of the redshift-space luminosity-weighted or 'marked' correlation function in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These are compared with a model in which the luminosity function and luminosity dependence of clustering are the same as that observed, and in which the form of the luminosity-weighted correlation function is entirely a consequence of the fact that massive haloes populate dense regions. We do this by using mock catalogues which are constrained to reproduce the observed luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of clustering, as well as by using the language of the redshift-space halo model. These analyses show that marked correlations may show a signal on large scales even if there are no large-scale physical effects - the statistical correlation between haloes and their environment will produce a measurable signal. Our model is in good agreement with the measurements, indicating that the halo mass function in dense regions is top heavy; the correlation between halo mass and large-scale environment is the primary driver for correlations between galaxy properties and environment; and the luminosity of the central galaxy in a halo is different from (in general, brighter than) that of the other objects in the halo. Thus our measurement provides strong evidence for the accuracy of these three standard assumptions of galaxy formation models. These assumptions also form the basis of current halo-model-based interpretations of galaxy clustering. When the same galaxies are weighted by their u-, g- or r-band luminosities, then the marked correlation function is stronger in the redder bands. When the weight is galaxy colour rather than luminosity, then the data suggest that close pairs of galaxies tend to have redder colours. This wavelength dependence of marked correlations is in qualitative agreement with galaxy formation models, and reflects the fact that the mean luminosity of galaxies in a halo depends more strongly on halo mass in the r-band than in u. The luminosity and colour dependence we find are consistent with models in which the galaxy population in clusters is more massive than the population in the field. If the u-band luminosity is a reliable tracer of star formation, then our results suggest that cluster galaxies have lower star formation rates. The virtue of this measurement of environmental trends is that it does not require classification of galaxies into field, group and cluster environments. \textcopyright{} 2006 RAS.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of the luminosity and color-dependence of galaxy clustering at 0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.0 in the Prism Multi-object Survey. We quantify the clustering with the redshift-space and projected two-point correlation functions, {$\xi$}(rp , {$\pi$}) and wp (rp ), using volume-limited samples constructed from a parent sample of over {$\sim$}130, 000 galaxies with robust redshifts in seven independent fields covering 9 deg 2 of sky. We quantify how the scale-dependent clustering amplitude increases with increasing luminosity and redder color, with relatively small errors over large volumes. We find that red galaxies have stronger small-scale (0.1 Mpc h -1 {$<$} rp {$<$} 1 Mpc h -1) clustering and steeper correlation functions compared to blue galaxies, as well as a strong color dependent clustering within the red sequence alone. We interpret our measured clustering trends in terms of galaxy bias and obtain values of bgal {$\approx$} 0.9-2.5, quantifying how galaxies are biased tracers of dark matter depending on their luminosity and color. We also interpret the color dependence with mock catalogs, and find that the clustering of blue galaxies is nearly constant with color, while redder galaxies have stronger clustering in the one-halo term due to a higher satellite galaxy fraction. In addition, we measure the evolution of the clustering strength and bias, and we do not detect statistically significant departures from passive evolution. We argue that the luminosity- and color-environment (or halo mass) relations of galaxies have not significantly evolved since z {$\sim$} 1. Finally, using jackknife subsampling methods, we find that sampling fluctuations are important and that the COSMOS field is generally an outlier, due to having more overdense structures than other fields; we find that "cosmic variance" can be a significant source of uncertainty for high-redshift clustering measurements. \textcopyright{} 2014.

It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested"contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic relabelling) allows the method to deal with a class of phasechange problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing. \textcopyright{} 2006 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.},

We compare students' engagement with experimentation during the lab as well as the impacts on students' exam performance and attitudes and beliefs about experimental physics. We find no measurable differences between lab conditions on students' exam performance. Nonetheless, we find measurable and significant improvements in students' engagement in expertlike experimentation practices and attitudes and beliefs about experimental physics for students in the experimentation labs. The benefits of the experimentation labs are stable across two subsequent semesters of implementation, as measured via standardized assessments. The results provide direct evidence of the extensive benefits of using labs to teach experimentation while directly demonstrating that shifting instructional goals and structure in labs can occur without cost to performance on course exams.},

In typical GAN architectures these images are small, but a variant known as Spatial-GANs (SGANs) can generate arbitrarily large images, provided training images exhibit some level of periodicity. Deep extragalactic imaging surveys meet this criteria due to the cosmological tenet of isotropy. Here we train an SGAN to generate images resembling the iconic Hubble Space Telescope eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). We show that the properties of 'galaxies' in generated images have a high level of fidelity with galaxies in the real XDF in terms of abundance, morphology, magnitude distributions and colours. As a demonstration we have generated a 7.6-billion pixel 'generative deep field' spanning 1.45 degrees. The technique can be generalised to any appropriate imaging training set, offering a new purely data-driven approach for producing realistic mock surveys and synthetic data at scale, in astrophysics and beyond.},

  abstract = {The fine-structure constant, {$\alpha$}, controls the strength of the electromagnetic interaction. There are extensions of the standard model in which {$\alpha$} is dynamical on cosmological length and time scales. The physics of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) depends on the value of {$\alpha$}. The effects of spatial variation in {$\alpha$} on the CMB are similar to those produced by weak lensing: smoothing of the power spectrum, and generation of non-Gaussian features. These would induce a bias to estimates of the weak-lensing potential power spectrum of the CMB. Using this effect, Planck measurements of the temperature and polarization power spectrum, as well as estimates of CMB lensing, are used to place limits (95\% C.L.) on the amplitude of a scale-invariant angular power spectrum of {$\alpha$} fluctuations relative to the mean value (CL{$\alpha$}=ASI{$\alpha$}/[L(L+1)]) of ASI{$\alpha\leq$}1.6\texttimes 10-5. The limits depend on the assumed shape of the {$\alpha$}-fluctuation power spectrum. For example, for a white-noise angular power spectrum (CL{$\alpha$}=AWN{$\alpha$}), the limit is AWN{$\alpha\leq$}2.3\texttimes 10-8. It is found that the response of the CMB to {$\alpha$} fluctuations depends on a separate-universe approximation, such that theoretical predictions are only reliable for {$\alpha$} multipoles with L100. An optimal trispectrum estimator can be constructed and it is found that it is only marginally more sensitive than lensing techniques for Planck but significantly more sensitive when considering the next generation of experiments. For a future CMB experiment with cosmic-variance limited polarization sensitivity (e.g., CMB-S4), the optimal estimator could detect {$\alpha$} fluctuations with ASI{$\alpha>$}1.9\texttimes 10-6 and AWN{$\alpha>$}1.4\texttimes 10-9.},

  abstract = {Wide-angle photometric surveys of previously uncharted sky areas or wavelength regimes will always bring in unexpected sources whose existence and properties cannot be easily predicted from earlier observations: novelties or even anomalies. Such objects can be efficiently sought for with novelty detection algorithms. Here we present an application of such a method, called one-class support vector machines (OCSVM), to search for anomalous patterns among sources preselected from the mid-infrared AllWISE catalogue covering the whole sky. To create a model of expected data we train the algorithm on a set of objects with spectroscopic identifications from the SDSS DR13 database, present also in AllWISE. OCSVM detects as anomalous those sources whose patterns - WISE photometric measurements in this case - are inconsistent with the model. Among the detected anomalies we find artefacts, such as objects with spurious photometry due to blending, but most importantly also real sources of genuine astrophysical interest. Among the latter, OCSVM has identified a sample of heavily reddened AGN/quasar candidates distributed uniformly over the sky and in a large part absent from other WISE-based AGN catalogues. It also allowed us to find a specific group of sources of mixed types, mostly stars and compact galaxies. By combining the semi-supervised OCSVM algorithm with standard classification methods it will be possible to improve the latter by accounting for sources which are not present in the training sample but are otherwise well-represented in the target set. Anomaly detection adds flexibility to automated source separation procedures and helps verify the reliability and representativeness of the training samples. It should be thus considered as an essential step in supervised classification schemes to ensure completeness and purity of produced catalogues.},

Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z\textbackslash sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growth of supermassive black holes (BH) and their host galaxies within the context of the Lambda cold dark matter ( CDM) cosmological framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accreting black holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational measurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation rates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential cut-off in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities at z {$\sim$} 0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely, quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of self-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between BH mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies and black holes in our models, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass assembly, cold gas and metals. We find that models assuming the `concordance' CDM cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at high redshift (z 2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star formation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in quasar absorption systems at high redshift (z {$\sim$} 3\textendash 4).},

We find that the predicted stellar properties of galaxies (stellar mass, SFR, metallicity) are remarkably insensitive to the details of the recipes used for partitioning gas into H~i and H2. We see significant sensitivity to the recipes for H2 formation only in very low mass haloes (\$M\_\{\textbackslash rm h\} \textbackslash lesssim 10\^\{10.5\}\textbackslash, \{\{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\{\{\textbackslash odot \}\}\}\$), which host galaxies with stellar masses \$m\_* \textbackslash lesssim 10\^8\textbackslash, \{\{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\{\{\textbackslash odot \}\}\}\$. The properties of low-mass galaxies are also quite insensitive to the details of the recipe used for converting H2 into stars, while the formation epoch of massive galaxies does depend on this significantly. We argue that this behaviour can be interpreted within the framework of a simple equilibrium model for galaxy evolution, in which the conversion of cold gas into stars is balanced on average by inflows and outflows.},

Regions with shock-like excitation were identified in two kinematically distinct regimes, characterized by broad ({$\sigma$} {$>$} 150kms-1) and narrow linewidths ({$\sigma$} {$\leq$} 150kms-1). Here, we investigate the physical origin of the broad emission, which we show is predominantly excited by shocks with velocities of 200-300kms-1. Considering the large amount of extinction in these galaxies, the blueshift of the broad emission suggests an origin on the near side of the galaxy and therefore an interpretation as a galactic outflow. The large spatial extent of the broad, shocked emission component is generally inconsistent with an origin in the narrow-line region of an active galactic nucleus. The kinetic energy in the mass loss as well as the luminosity of the emission lines is consistent with the fraction of the supernova energy attributed to these mechanisms by shocked stellar winds. Since some shocks can be recognized in moderately high resolution, integrated spectra of nearby ultraluminous starbursts, the spectral fitting technique introduced in Soto \& Martin may therefore be used to improve the accuracy of the physical properties measured for high-redshift galaxies from their (observed frame) infrared spectra. \textcopyright{} 2012.

Using WMAP data only, the bestfit values for cosmological parameters for the power-law flat \~A cold dark matter (\~ACDM) model are ( mh 2;  bh 2; h; ns;  ;  8) {$\frac{1}{4}$} (0:1277\th\`A00::00008709;0:02229 \AE{} 0:00073;0:732\th\`A00::003312;0:958 \AE{} 0:016;0:089 \AE{} 0:030; 0:761\th\`A00::004498). The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six-dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power-law spectrum, the WMAP data alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum (ns {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1; r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0). Adding additional data sets improves the constraints on these components and the spectral slope. For power-law models, WMAP data alone puts an improved upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r0:002 {$<$} 0:65 (95\% CL) and the combination of WMAP and the lensing-normalized SDSS galaxy survey implies r0:002 {$<$} 0:30 (95\% CL). Models that suppress largescale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale cutoff in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and small-scale CMB data than the power-law \~ACDM model; however, the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only \'A 2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. Models with a running-spectral index are consistent with a higher amplitude of gravity waves.

The combination of WMAP 3 year data plus the HST Key Project constraint on H0 implies  k {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0:014 \AE{} 0:017 and  \~A {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:716 \AE{} 0:055. Even if we do not include the prior that the universe is flat, by combining WMAP, large-scale structure, and supernova data, we can still put a strong constraint on the dark energy equation of state, w {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A1:08 \AE{} 0:12. For a flat unP iverse, the combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yield a constraint on the sum of the neutrino masses, m  {$<$} 0:66 eV (95\%CL). Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps using Minkowski functionals, the bispectrum, trispectrum, and a new statistic designed to detect large-scale anisotropies in the fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k {$\sim$} 10 h Mpc-1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z {$\simeq$} 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109-1010 h-2 M{$\odot$}. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope {$\gamma$} is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.6 at redshift z {$\sim$} 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around {$\sim$} 5 per cent.},

  abstract = {We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5e7 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publically release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

The emulators replace the computation of matter and CMB power spectra from Boltzmann codes; thus, they do not need to be retrained for different choices of astrophysical nuisance parameters or redshift distributions. The matter power spectrum emulation error is less than 0.4\% in the wavenumber range \'i \textmu\'i{$\pm$} {$\in$} [10 -5 , 10] Mpc -1 , for redshift \'i \textmu\'i{$\pm$} \textsection{} {$\in$} [0, 5]. CCCCCPPPPP emulates CMB temperature, polarisation and lensing potential power spectra in the 5\'i \textmu\'i{$\frac{1}{4}$} region of parameter space around the Planck best fit values with an error 10\% of the expected shot noise for the forthcoming Simons Observatory. CCCCCPPPPP is showcased on a joint cosmic shear and galaxy clustering analysis from the Kilo-Degree Survey, as well as on a Stage IV Euclid-like simulated cosmic shear analysis. For the CMB case, CCCCCPPPPP is tested on a Planck 2018 CMB temperature and polarisation analysis. The emulators always recover the fiducial cosmological constraints with differences in the posteriors smaller than sampling noise, while providing a speed-up factor up to \'i \textmu\'i{$\pm$} (10 4) to the complete inference pipeline. This acceleration allows posterior distributions to be recovered in just a few seconds, as we demonstrate in the Planck likelihood case. CCCCCPPPPP is written entirely in PPPPPP, can be interfaced with all commonly used cosmological samplers and is publicly available .},

  abstract = {We apply machine learning, a powerful method for uncovering complex correlations in high-dimensional data, to the galaxy-halo connection of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The mapping between galaxy and halo variables is stochastic in the absence of perfect information, but conventional machine learning models are deterministic and hence cannot capture its intrinsic scatter. To overcome this limitation, we design an ensemble of neural networks with a Gaussian loss function that predict probability distributions, allowing us to model statistical uncertainties in the galaxy-halo connection as well as its best-fit trends. We extract a number of galaxy and halo variables from the Horizon-AGN and IllustrisTNG100-1 simulations and quantify the extent to which knowledge of some subset of one enables prediction of the other. This allows us to identify the key features of the galaxy-halo connection and investigate the origin of its scatter in various projections. We find that while halo properties beyond mass account for up to 50 per cent of the scatter in the halo-to-stellar mass relation, the prediction of stellar half-mass radius or total gas mass is not substantially improved by adding further halo properties. We also use these results to investigate semi-analytic models for galaxy size in the two simulations, finding that assumptions relating galaxy size to halo size or spin are not successful.},

In this work, we use the AEMULUS suite of cosmological \$N\$-body simulations to construct Gaussian process emulators of galaxy clustering statistics at small scales (\$0.1-50 \textbackslash : h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\$) in order to constrain cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. In addition to standard statistics -- the projected correlation function \$w\_\textbackslash mathrm\{p\}(r\_\textbackslash mathrm\{p\})\$, the redshift-space monopole of the correlation function \$\textbackslash xi\_0(s)\$, and the quadrupole \$\textbackslash xi\_2(s)\$ -- we emulate statistics that include information about the local environment, namely the underdensity probability function \$P\_\textbackslash mathrm\{U\}(s)\$ and the density-marked correlation function \$M(s)\$. This extends the model of AEMULUS III for redshift-space distortions by including new statistics sensitive to galaxy assembly bias. In recovery tests, we find that the beyond-standard statistics significantly increase the constraining power on cosmological parameters of interest: including \$P\_\textbackslash mathrm\{U\}(s)\$ and \$M(s)\$ improves the precision of our constraints on \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ by 33\%, \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$ by 28\%, and the growth of structure parameter, \$f \textbackslash sigma\_8\$, by 18\% compared to standard statistics. We additionally find that scales below \$4 \textbackslash : h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\$ contain as much information as larger scales. The density-sensitive statistics also contribute to constraining halo occupation distribution parameters and a flexible environment-dependent assembly bias model, which is important for extracting the small-scale cosmological information as well as understanding the galaxy-halo connection. This analysis demonstrates the potential of emulating beyond-standard clustering statistics at small scales to constrain the growth of structure as a test of cosmic acceleration.

We present the results of an unsupervised anomaly detection method using a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) on nearly one million optical galaxy images in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. The WGAN learns to generate realistic HSC-like galaxies that follow the distribution of the data set; anomalous images are defined based on a poor reconstruction by the generator and outlying features learned by the discriminator. We find that the discriminator is more attuned to potentially interesting anomalies compared to the generator, and compared to a simpler autoencoder-based anomaly detection approach, so we use the discriminator-selected images to construct a high-anomaly sample of {$\sim$}13 000 objects. We propose a new approach to further characterize these anomalous images: we use a convolutional autoencoder to reduce the dimensionality of the residual differences between the real and WGAN-reconstructed images and perform UMAP clustering on these. We report detected anomalies of interest including galaxy mergers, tidal features, and extreme star-forming galaxies. A follow-up spectroscopic analysis of one of these anomalies is detailed in the Appendix; we find that it is an unusual system most likely to be a metal-poor dwarf galaxy with an extremely blue, higher-metallicity H II region. We have released a catalogue with the WGAN anomaly scores; the code and catalogue are available at https://github.com/kstoreyf/anomalies-GAN-HSC; and our interactive visualization tool for exploring the clustered data is at https://weirdgalaxi.es.},

  abstract = {Accurate statistical measurement with large imaging surveys has traditionally required throwing away a sizable fraction of the data. This is because most measurements have relied on selecting nearly complete samples, where variations in the composition of the galaxy population with seeing, depth, or other survey characteristics are small. We introduce a new measurement method that aims to minimize this wastage, allowing precision measurement for any class of detectable stars or galaxies. We have implemented our proposal in BALROG, software which embeds fake objects in real imaging to accurately characterize measurement biases. We demonstrate this technique with an angular clustering measurement using Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We first show that recovery of our injected galaxies depends on a variety of survey characteristics in the same way as the real data. We then construct a fluxlimited sample of the faintest galaxies in DES, chosen specifically for their sensitivity to depth and seeing variations. Using the synthetic galaxies as randoms in the Landy-Szalay estimator suppresses the effects of variable survey selection by at least two orders of magnitude. With this correction, our measured angular clustering is found to be in excellent agreement with that of a matched sample from much deeper, higher resolution space-based Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) imaging; over angular scales of 0.\textdegree 004 {$<$} \texttheta{} {$<$} 0.\textdegree 2, we find a best-fitting scaling amplitude between the DES and COSMOS measurements of 1.00 {$\pm$} 0.09. We expect this methodology to be broadly useful for extending measurements' statistical reach in a variety of upcoming imaging surveys.},

Based on these density peaks, dark matter halos are identified as spherical overdensity structures, and subhalos are bound substructures with boundaries at their tidal radius. By testing HIKER code with mock halos, we show that HIKER performs excellently in recovering input halo properties. Especially, HIKER has higher accuracy in locating halo/subhalo centres than most halo finders. With cosmological simulations, we further show that HIKER reproduces the abundance of dark matter halos and subhalos quite accurately, and the HIKER halo/subhalo mass functions and V max functions are in good agreement with two widely used halo finders, SUBFIND and AHF.},

We also study the relativistic pairing GAN (RpGAN) loss which couples the generated samples and the true samples. We prove that RpGAN has no bad basins. Experiments on synthetic data show that the predicted bad basin can indeed appear in training. We also perform experiments to support our theory that RpGAN has a better landscape than separable-GAN.

  abstract = {Narrow-line regions excited by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are important for studying AGN photoionization and feedback. Their strong [OIII] lines can be detected with broad-band images, allowing morphological studies of these systems with large-area imaging surveys. We develop a new broad-band imaging technique to reconstruct the images of the [OIII] line, using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey aided with spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The technique involves a careful subtraction of the galactic continuum to isolate emission from the [OIII]{$\lambda$}5007 and [O III]{$\lambda$}4959 lines. Compared to traditional targeted observations, this technique is more efficient at covering larger samples without dedicated observational resources. We apply this technique to an SDSS spectroscopically selected sample of 300 obscured AGN at redshifts 0.1-0.7, uncovering extended emission-line region candidates with sizes up to tens of kpc. With the largest sample of uniformly derived narrow-line region sizes, we revisit the narrow-line region size-luminosity relation. The area and radii of the [OIII] emission-line regions are strongly correlated with the AGN luminosity inferred from the mid-infrared (15 {$\mu$}m rest frame) with a power-law slope of 0.62 -0.06+0.05 {$\pm$} 0.10 (statistical and systematic errors), consistent with previous spectroscopic findings. We discuss the implications for the physics of AGN emission-line regions and future applications of this technique, which should be useful for current and next-generation imaging surveys to study AGN photoionization and feedback with large statistical samples.},

Such works are often plagued by systematic errors or limited to clustering statistics that can be predicted analytically. In this work, we employ a numerical mock-based modeling procedure to examine the clustering of Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 galaxies. We apply a standard halo occupation distribution (HOD) model to dark matter only simulations with a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. To constrain the theoreStical models, we utilize a combination of galaxy number density and selected scales of the projected correlation function, redshift-space correlation function, group multiplicity function, average group velocity dispersion, mark correlation function, and counts-in-cells statistics. We design an algorithm to choose an optimal combination of measurements that yields tight and accurate constraints on our model parameters. Compared to previous work using fewer clustering statistics, we find a significant improvement in the constraints on all parameters of our halo model for two different luminosity-threshold galaxy samples. Most interestingly, we obtain unprecedented high-precision constraints on the scatter in the relationship between galaxy luminosity and halo mass. However, our best-fit model results in significant tension ({$>$}4 {$\sigma$} ) for both samples, indicating the need to add second-order features to the standard HOD model. To guarantee the robustness of these results, we perform an extensive analysis of the systematic and statistical errors in our modeling procedure, including a first of its kind study of the sensitivity of our constraints to changes in the halo mass function due to baryonic physics.},

Here, we summarize the science cases in terms of provisional plans for a 300-night Subaru survey. We describe plans to constrain the nature of dark energy via a survey of emission line galaxies spanning a comoving volume of 9.3 h-3 Gpc3 in the redshift range 0.8 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.4. In each of six redshift bins, the cosmological distances will be measured to 3\% precision via the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale, and redshift-space distortion measures will constrain structure growth to 6\% precision. In the near-field cosmology program, radial velocities and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way and M 31 will be used to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies and the structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for 106 stars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo, and tidal streams as faint as V {$\sim$} 22, including stars with V {$<$} 20 to complement the goals of the Gaia mission. A medium-resolution mode with R = 5000 to be implemented in the red arm will allow the measurement of multiple {$\alpha$}-element abundances and more precise velocities for Galactic stars. For the galaxy evolution program, our simulations suggest the wide wavelength range of PFS will be powerful in probing the galaxy population and its clustering over a wide redshift range. We plan to conduct a color-selected survey of 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 2 galaxies and AGN over 16 deg2 to J 23.4, yielding a fair sample of galaxies with stellar masses above {$\sim$}1010 M at z 2.

  abstract = {With the advent of high-quality surveys in cosmology, the full three-point correlation function (3PCF) will be a valuable statistic for describing structure formation models. It contains information on cosmological parameters and detailed halo properties that cannot be extracted from the two-point correlation function. We use the halo clustering model to calculate the three-point correlation function analytically for general cosmological fields. We present detailed results for the configuration dependence of the three-dimensional mass and galaxy distributions and the two-dimensional cosmic shear field. We work in real space, where higher order correlation functions on small scales are easier to measure and interpret, but halo model calculations become rapidly intractable. Hence we develop techniques that allow for the accurate evaluation of all the contributing terms to real-space correlations. We apply them to the 3PCF to show how its configuration and scale dependence change as one transits from the non-linear to the quasilinear regime, and how this depends on the relative contributions from the one-, two- and three-halo terms. The 3PCF violates the hierarchical Ansatz in both its scale and configuration dependence. We study the behaviour of the coefficient Q in the expansion: {$\zeta$} (r12, r23, r31) = Q[{$\xi$} (r12) {$\xi$} (r23) + {$\xi$}(r12){$\xi$}(r 31) + {$\xi$}(r23){$\xi$}(r31)] from large, quasilinear scales down to approximately 20 kpc. We find that the non-linear 3PCF is sensitive to the halo profile of massive haloes, especially its inner slope. We model the distribution of galaxies in haloes and show that the 3PCF of red galaxies has a weaker configuration and scale dependence than the mass, while for blue galaxies it is very sensitive to the parameters of the galaxy formation model. The 3PCF from weak lensing on the other hand shows different scalings arising from projection effects and a sensitivity to cosmological parameters. We discuss how our results can be applied to various analytical calculations: covariances of the two-point correlation function, the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion, higher order shear correlations, and to extend the halo model by including the effects of halo triaxiality and substructure on statistical measures.},

  abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation requires that the likelihood function of the data is accurately known. Assuming that cosmological large-scale structure power spectra data are multivariate Gaussian distributed, we show that the accuracy of parameter estimation is limited by the accuracy of the inverse data covariance matrix - the precision matrix. If the data covariance and precision matrices are estimated by sampling independent realizations of the data, their statistical properties are described by theWishart and inverse-Wishart distributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show that the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a figure of merit, is equal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the only unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional accuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the number of independent realizations and the number of data points, and so can easily diverge. For a 5 per cent error on a parameter error and ND \guillemotleft{} 102 data points, a minimum of 200 realizations of the survey are needed, with 10 per cent accuracy in the data covariance. If the number of data points ND \guillemotright{} 102, we need NS {$>$} ND realizations and a fractional accuracy of {$<$} {$\surd$}2/ND in the data covariance. As the number of power spectra data points grows to ND {$>$} 104-106, this approach will be problematic. We discuss possible ways to relax these conditions: improved theoretical modelling, shrinkage methods, data compression, simulation and data resampling methods. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

For sampled data covariances with Gaussian-distributed data and parameters, the parameter covariance matrix estimated from the width of the likelihood has aWishart distribution, from which we derive the mean and covariance. This mean is biased and we propose an unbiased estimator of the parameter covariance matrix. Comparing our analytic results to a numerical Wishart sampler of the data covariance matrix we find excellent agreement. An accurate ansatz for the mean parameter covariance for the peak scatter estimator is found, and we fit its covariance to our numerical analysis. The mean is again biased and we propose an unbiased estimator for the peak parameter covariance. For sampled data covariances, the width estimator is more accurate than the peak scatter estimator. We investigate modelling the data covariance, or equivalently data compression, and show that the peak scatter estimator is less sensitive to biases in the model data covariance matrix than the width estimator, but requires independent realizations of the data to reduce the statistical error. If the model bias on the peak estimator is sufficiently low, this is promising, otherwise the sampled width estimator is preferable \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

We employ a matrix-based power spectrum estimation method using Pseudo-Karhunen-Lo\`eve eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated minimum-variance measurements in 20 k-bands of both the clustering power and its anisotropy due to redshift-space distortions, with narrow and well-behaved window functions in the range 0.01h/Mpcm and the baryon fraction in good agreement with WMAP. Within the context of flat {$\Lambda$}CDM models, our LRG measurements complement WMAP by sharpening the constraints on the matter density, the neutrino density and the tensor amplitude by about a factor of 2, giving {$\Omega$}m=0.24{$\pm$}0.02 (1{$\sigma$}), {$\sum$}m{$\nu\lessequivlnt$}0.9eV (95\%) and r{$<$}0.3 (95\%). Baryon oscillations are clearly detected and provide a robust measurement of the comoving distance to the median survey redshift z=0.35 independent of curvature and dark energy properties. Within the {$\Lambda$}CDM framework, our power spectrum measurement improves the evidence for spatial flatness, sharpening the curvature constraint {$\Omega$}tot=1.05{$\pm$}0.05 from WMAP alone to {$\Omega$}tot=1.003{$\pm$}0.010. Assuming {$\Omega$}tot=1, the equation of state parameter is constrained to w=-0.94{$\pm$}0.09, indicating the potential for more ambitious future LRG measurements to provide precision tests of the nature of dark energy. All these constraints are essentially independent of scales k{$>$}0.1h/Mpc and associated nonlinear complications, yet agree well with more aggressive published analyses where nonlinear modeling is crucial.},

We present a rigorous discussion of different methods of power spectrum estimation, with emphasis on the traditional Fourier method, the linear (Karhunen-Loeve; KL), and quadratic data compression schemes, showing in what approximations they give the same result. To improve speed, we show how many of the advantages of KL data compression and power spectrum estimation may be achieved with a computationally faster quadratic method. To improve accuracy, we derive analytic expressions for handling the integral constraint, since it is crucial that finite volume effects are accurately corrected for on scales comparable to the depth of the survey. We also show that for the KL and quadratic techniques, multiple constraints can be included via simple matrix operations, thereby rendering the results less sensitive to galactic extinction and mis-estimates of the radial selection function. We present a data analysis pipeline that we argue does justice to the increases in both quality and quantity of data that upcoming redshift surveys will provide. It uses three analysis techniques in conjunction: a traditional Fourier approach on small scales, a pixelized quadratic matrix method on large scales and a pixelized KL eigenmode analysis to probe anisotropic effects such as redshift-space distortions.},

  abstract = {Percent-level measurements of the comoving baryon acoustic scale standard ruler can be used to break degeneracies in parameter constraints from the CMB alone. The sound horizon at the epoch of baryon drag is often used as a proxy for the scale of the peak in the matter density correlation function, and can conveniently be calculated quickly for different cosmological models. However, the measurements are not directly constraining this scale, but rather a measurement of the full correlation function, which depends on the detailed evolution through decoupling. We assess the level of reliability of parameter constraints based on a simple approximation of the acoustic scale compared to a more direct determination from the full numerical two-point correlation function. Using a five-parameter fitting technique similar to recent BAO data analyses, we find that for standard {$\Lambda$}CDM models and extensions with massive neutrinos and additional relativistic degrees of freedom, the approximation is at better than 0.15\% for most parameter combinations varying over reasonable ranges.},

  abstract = {Theoretical uncertainty limits our ability to extract cosmological information from baryonic fields such as the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Being sourced by the electron pressure field, the tSZ effect depends on baryonic physics that is usually modeled by expensive hydrodynamic simulations. We train neural networks on the IllustrisTNG-300 cosmological simulation to predict the continuous electron pressure field in galaxy clusters from gravity-only simulations. Modeling clusters is challenging for neural networks as most of the gas pressure is concentrated in a handful of voxels and even the largest hydrodynamical simulations contain only a few hundred clusters that can be used for training. Instead of conventional convolutional neural net (CNN) architectures, we choose to employ a rotationally equivariant DeepSets architecture to operate directly on the set of dark matter particles. We argue that set-based architectures provide distinct advantages over CNNs. For example, we can enforce exact rotational and permutation equivariance, incorporate existing knowledge on the tSZ field, and work with sparse fields as are standard in cosmology. We compose our architecture with separate, physically meaningful modules, making it amenable to interpretation. For example, we can separately study the influence of local and cluster-scale environment, determine that cluster triaxiality has negligible impact, and train a module that corrects for mis-centering. Our model improves by 70 \% on analytic profiles fit to the same simulation data. We argue that the electron pressure field, viewed as a function of a gravity-only simulation, has inherent stochasticity, and model this property through a conditional-VAE extension to the network. This modification yields further improvement by 7 \%, it is limited by our small training set however. (abridged)},

We compare the clustering of samples using 12 different methods for estimating stellar mass, isolating the method that has the smallest scatter at fixed halo mass. In this test, the stellar mass estimate with the smallest errors yields the highest amplitude of clustering at fixed number density. We find that the PCA stellar masses of Chen et al. (2012) clearly have the tightest correlation with halo mass. The PCA masses use the full galaxy spectrum, differentiating them from other estimates that only use optical photomet-ric information. Using the PCA masses, we measure the large-scale bias as a function of M * for galaxies with log M * {$\geq$} 11.4, correcting for incompleteness at the low-mass end of our measurements. Using the abundance-matching ansatz to connect dark matter halo mass to stellar mass, we construct theoretical models of b(M *) that match the same stellar mass function but have different amounts of scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass, {$\sigma$} log M *. Using this approach, we find {$\sigma$} log M * = 0.18 +0.01 -0.02. This value includes both intrinsic scatter as well as random errors in the stellar masses. To partially remove the latter, we use repeated spectra to estimate statistical errors on the stellar masses, yielding an upper limit to the intrinsic scatter of 0.16 dex.},

We adopt a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological scenario (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant) and use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework to describe the relation between galaxies and dark matter. After choosing HOD parameters that reproduce the mean space density \textasciimacron{} n g and projected correlation function w p (r p) measuremed for galaxy samples with M r {$<$} -19 and M r {$<$} -21 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we predict the void probability function (VPF) and underdensity probability function (UPF) of these samples by populating the halos of a large, high-resolution N-body simulation (400h -1 Mpc, 1280 3 particles). If we make the conventional simplifying assumption that the HOD is independent of large scale environment at fixed halo mass, then models constrained to match \textasciimacron{} n g and w p (r p) predict nearly identical void statistics, independent of the scatter between halo mass and central galaxy luminosity or statistical uncertainties in HOD parameters. Models with power spectrum normalizations {$\sigma$} 8 = 0.7 and {$\sigma$} 8 = 0.9 also predict very similar void statistics, with stronger galaxy bias compensating for weaker dark matter fluctuations in the low-{$\sigma$} 8 model. However, the VPF and UPF are sensitive to environmental variations of the HOD in a regime where these variations have little impact on w p (r p). For example, doubling the minimum host halo mass in regions with large scale (5h -1 Mpc) density contrast {$\delta$} {$<$} -0.65 has a readily detectable impact on void probabilities of M r {$<$} -19 galaxies, and a similar change for {$\delta$} {$<$} -0.2 alters the void probabilities of M r {$<$} -21 galaxies at a detectable level. The VPF and UPF provide complementary information about the onset and magnitude of density-dependence in the HOD. By detecting or ruling out HOD changes in low density regions, void statistics can reduce systematic uncertainties in the cosmological constraints derived from HOD modeling, and, more importantly, reveal connections between halo formation history and galaxy properties.

We find that, with robust estimates of the measurement errors and realistic halo occupation distribution mod-eling, the measured clustering can be well fit within standard halo occupation models, in contrast to previous results. However, in order to fit the strong break in w(\texttheta ) at \texttheta{} = 10 {${'}{'}$} , nearly all satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range are required to be DRGs. Within this luminosity-threshold sample, the fraction of galaxies that are DRGs is {$\sim$} 44\%, implying that the formation of DRGs is more efficient for satellite galaxies than for central galaxies. Despite the evolved stellar populations contained within DRGs at z = 2.3, 90\% of satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range have been accreted within 500 Myr. Thus, satellite DRGs must have known they would become satellites well before the time of their accretion. This implies that the formation of DRGs correlates with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass, although the large-scale bias of DRGs can be well fit without such assumptions. Further data are required to resolve this issue. Using the observational estimate that {$\sim$} 30\% of DRGs have no ongoing star formation, we infer a timescale for star formation quenching for satellite galaxies of 450 Myr, although the uncertainty on this number is large. However, unless all non-star forming satellite DRGs were quenched before accretion, the quenching timescale is significantly shorter than z {$\sim$} 0 estimates. Down to the completeness limit of the Quadri et al sample, we find that the halo masses of central DRGs are {$\sim$} 50\% higher than non-DRGs in the same luminosity range, but at the highest halo masses the central galaxies are DRGs only {$\sim$} 2/3 of the time.},

We present new measurements of the void probability function (VPF) and underdensity probability function (UPF) from Data Release Four of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), as well as new measurements of the VPF from the full data release of the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. We compare these measurements to predictions calculated from models of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) that are constrained to match both the projected correlation function w p (r p) and the space density of galaxies \textasciimacron{} n g. The standard implementation of the HOD assumes that galaxy occupation depends on halo mass only, and is independent of local environment. For luminosity-defined samples, we find that the standard HOD prediction is a good match to the observations, and the data exclude models in which galaxy formation efficiency is reduced in low-density environments. For L {$\star$} samples we cannot rule out a slight increase in galaxy formation efficiency at low densities. More remarkably , we find that the void statistics of red and blue galaxies (at L {$\sim$} 0.4L {$\star$}) are perfectly predicted by standard HOD models matched to the correlation function of these samples, ruling out "assembly bias" models in which galaxy color is correlated with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. We conclude that the luminosity and color of field galaxies are determined predominantly by the mass of the halo in which they reside and have little direct dependence on the environment in which the host halo formed. In broader terms, our results show that the sizes and emptiness of voids found in the distribution of L 0.2L {$\star$} galaxies are in excellent agreement with the predictions of a standard cosmological model with a simple connection between galaxies and dark matter halos.},

We present new measurements of the void probability function (VPF) and underdensity probability function (UPF) from Data Release Four of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, as well as new measurements of the VPF from the full data release of the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. We compare these measurements to predictions calculated from models of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) that are constrained to match both w\_p and the space density of galaxies. The standard implementation of the HOD assumes that galaxy occupation depends on halo mass only, and is independent of local environment. For luminosity-defined samples, we find that the standard HOD prediction is a good match to the observations, and the data exclude models in which galaxy formation efficiency is reduced in low-density environments. More remarkably, we find that the void statistics of red and blue galaxies (at L \textasciitilde{} 0.4L\_*) are perfectly predicted by standard HOD models matched to the correlation function of these samples, ruling out "assembly bias" models in which galaxy color is correlated with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. We conclude that the luminosity and color of field galaxies are determined predominantly by the mass of the halo in which they reside and have little direct dependence on the environment in which the host halo formed. In broader terms, our results show that the sizes and emptiness of voids found in the distribution of L {$>$} 0.2L\_* galaxies are in excellent agreement with the predictions of a standard cosmological model with a simple connection between galaxies and dark matter halos.

  abstract = {We explore methods for robust estimation of the 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) is introduced for measuring the spatial temperature fluctuation power spectrum from the EoR. The KDE estimates the underlying probability distribution function of fluctuations as a function of spatial scale, and contains different systematic biases and errors to the typical approach to estimating the fluctuation power spectrum. Extraction of histograms of visibilities allows moments analysis to be used to discriminate foregrounds from 21 cm signal and thermal noise. We use the information available in the histograms, along with the statistical dis-similarity of foregrounds from two independent observing fields, to robustly separate foregrounds from cosmological signal, while making no assumptions about the Gaussianity of the signal. Using two independent observing fields to robustly discriminate signal from foregrounds is crucial for the analysis presented in this paper. We apply the techniques to 13 h of Murchison Widefield Array EoR data over two observing fields. We compare the output to that obtained with a comparative power spectrum estimation method, and demonstrate the reduced foreground contamination using this approach. Using the second moment obtained directly from the KDE distribution functions yields a factor of 2-3 improvement in power for k {$<$} 0.3 h Mpc-1 compared with a matched delay space power estimator, while weighting data by additional statistics does not offer significant improvement beyond that available for thermal noise-only weights.},

This survey has yielded 39 spectra of z\_em \textasciitilde{} 0.5 QSOs with S/N \textasciitilde{} 10-15 per resolution element. The QSO sightlines pass within 150 physical kpc of the galaxies, which span early and late types over stellar mass log M* / Msun= 9.5 - 11.5. We find that the CGM exhibits strong HI, averaging 1 Ang in Lya equivalent width out to 150 kpc, with 100\% covering fraction for star-forming galaxies and 75\% covering for passive galaxies. We find good agreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies over similar range of impact parameter. There is weak evidence for a difference between early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of HI. Kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy, such that {$>\sptilde$}90\% of the detected column density is confined within +/-200 km s\^-1 of the galaxies. This material generally exists well below the halo virial temperatures at T{$<\sptilde$} 10\^5 K. We evaluate a number of possible origin scenarios for the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which the bulk of the detected HI arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionized diffuse medium that is generic to all L* galaxies and may harbor a total gaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.},

We describe the expected form of the cross-correlation and show how, if the distribution of UHECR sources trace the large-scale cosmic structure, it could be easier to detect with current data than the UHECR auto-correlation. Moreover, the cross-correlation is more sensitive to UHECR anisotropies on smaller angular scales, more robust to systematic uncertainties, and it could be used to determine the redshift distribution of UHECR sources, as well as the UHECR chemical composition, making it a valuable tool in determining their origins and properties.},

We propose achieving this task through the use of the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST), which subjects an input field to a layer of non-linear transformations that are sensitive to non-Gaussianity in spatial density distributions through a generated set of WST coefficients. In order to assess its applicability in the context of LSS surveys, we apply the WST on the 3D overdensity field obtained by the Quijote simulations, out of which we extract the Fisher information in 6 cosmological parameters. It is subsequently found to deliver a large improvement in the marginalized errors on all parameters, ranging between \$1.2-4\textbackslash times\$ tighter than the corresponding ones obtained from the regular 3D cold dark matter + baryon power spectrum, as well as a \$50 \textbackslash\%\$ improvement over the neutrino mass constraint given by the marked power spectrum. Through this first application on 3D cosmological fields, we demonstrate the great promise held by this novel statistic and set the stage for its future application to actual galaxy observations.},

  abstract = {We present a new method that simultaneously solves for cosmology and galaxy bias on non-linear scales. The method uses the halo model to analytically describe the (non-linear) matter distribution, and the conditional luminosity function (CLF) to specify the halo occupation statistics. For a given choice of cosmological parameters, this model can be used to predict the galaxy luminosity function, as well as the two-point correlation functions of galaxies, and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, both as function of scale and luminosity. These observables have been reliably measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In this paper, the first in a series, we present the detailed, analytical model, which we test against mock galaxy redshift surveys constructed from high-resolution numerical N-body simulations. We demonstrate that our model, which includes scale-dependence of the halo bias and a proper treatment of halo exclusion, reproduces the 3-dimensional galaxy-galaxy correlation and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation (which can be projected to predict the observables) with an accuracy better than 10 (in most cases 5) percent. Ignoring either of these effects, as is often done, results in systematic errors that easily exceed 40 percent on scales of {$\sim$} 1h -1 Mpc, where the data is typically most accurate. Finally, since the projected correlation functions of galaxies are never obtained by integrating the redshift space correlation function along the line-of-sight out to infinity, simply because the data only cover a finite volume, they are still affected by residual redshift space distortions (RRSDs). Ignoring these, as done in numerous studies in the past, results in systematic errors that easily exceed 20 perent on large scales (r p {$>$} {$\sim$} 10h -1 Mpc). We show that it is fairly straightforward to correct for these RRSDs, to an accuracy better than {$\sim$} 2 percent, using a mildly modified version of the linear Kaiser formalism.},

To provide transparency and create a nuanced picture of learning, we problematized the measurement of equity by using two competing operationalizations of equity: Equity of Individuality and Equality of Learning. These two models led to conflicting conclusions. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine student's conceptual learning as measured by gains in scores on research-based assessments administered as pretests and posttests. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes' (LASSO) national database and included data from 13,857 students in 187 first-semester college physics courses. Findings showed differences in student gains across gender and race. Large gender differences existed for White and Hispanic students but not for Asian, Black, and Pacific Islander students. The models predicted larger gains for students in collaborative learning than in lecture-based courses. The Equity of Individuality operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction improved equity because all groups learned more with collaborative learning. The Equality of Learning operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction did not improve equity because differences between groups were unaffected. We discuss the implications of these mixed findings and identify areas for future research using critical quantitative perspectives in education research.},

Three main results emerge from the X-Shooter spectrum: (a) the Ly{$\alpha$} has three distinct peaks with the central one at the systemic redshift, indicating a ionised tunnel through which both Ly{$\alpha$} and LyC radiation escape; (b) the large O32 oxygen index ([O iii]{$\lambda\lambda$}4959, 5007 / [Oii]{$\lambda$}3727, 3729) of 9.18 +1.82 -1.32 is compatible to those measured in local (z {$\sim$} 0.4) LyC leakers; (c) there are narrow nebular high-ionisation metal lines with {$\sigma$} v {$<$} 20 km s -1 , which confirms the presence of young hot, massive stars. The Heii{$\lambda$}1640 appears qualitatively broad, consistent with a young stellar component including Wolf-Rayet stars. Similarly, the Sunburst LyC-emitter shows a triple-peaked Ly{$\alpha$} profile and spectral features arising from young hot and massive stars. The strong lensing magnification , (\textmu{} {$>$} 30 - 50), makes this exceptional object the very likely first case of gravitationally-bound star cluster ever observed at a cosmological distance, with a stellar mass M 10 7 M and an effective radius smaller than 20 pc. Intriguingly, sources like Sunburst but without lensing magnification might appear as Ion2-like galaxies, in which spatially unresolved massive star clusters dominate the ultraviolet emission. This work supports the idea that dense young star clusters can contribute to the ionisation of the IGM through holes created by stellar feedback.},

The theoretical systematic uncertainties in BAO parameters are found to be 0.002 in the isotropic dilation {$\alpha$} and 0.003 in the quadrupolar dilation. The leading source of systematic uncertainty is related to the reconstruction techniques. Theoretical uncertainties are subdominant compared with the statistical uncertainties for BOSS survey, accounting 0.2{$\sigma$} stat for {$\alpha$} and 0.25{$\sigma$} stat for ({$\sigma$} {$\alpha$},stat {$\sim$}0.010 and {$\sigma$} ,stat {$\sim$} 0.012 respectively). We also present BAO-only distance scale constraints from the anisotropic analysis of the correlation function. Our constraints on the angular diameter distance D A (z) and the Hubble parameter H(z), including both statistical and theoretical systematic uncertainties, are 1.5\% and 2.8\% at z eff = 0.38, 1.4\% and 2.4\% at z eff = 0.51, and 1.7\% and 2.6\% at z eff = 0.61.

  abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between paircounts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model-independent estimator. Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT and N-Body), we obtain a 20-25\% gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and {$\Lambda$}CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15\% improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter {$\Omega$}m and dark energy {$\Omega\Lambda$} in an open {$\Lambda$}CDM model. The constraints derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large and has a density that is three times higher.},

  abstract = {Third generation gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect a large number of binary black holes (BBHs) to large redshifts, opening up an independent probe of the large scale structure using their clustering. This probe will be complementary to the probes using galaxy clustering -- GW events could be observed up to very large redshifts (\$z \textbackslash sim 10\$) although the source localization will be much poorer at large distances (\$\textbackslash sim\$ tens of square degrees). We explore the possibility of probing the large scale structure from the spatial distribution of the observed BBH population, using their two-point (auto)correlation function. We find that we can estimate the bias factor of population of BBH (up to \$z \textbackslash sim 1\$) with a few years of observations with these detectors. Our method relies solely on the source-location posteriors obtained the GW events and does not require any information from electromagnetic observations. This will help in identifying the type of galaxies that host the BBH population, thus shedding light on their origins.},

CAMELS is a suite of 4,233 cosmological simulations of \$(25\textasciitilde h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\})\^3\$ volume each: 2,184 state-of-the-art (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations run with the AREPO and GIZMO codes, employing the same baryonic subgrid physics as the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations, and 2,049 N-body simulations. The goal of the CAMELS project is to provide theory predictions for different observables as a function of cosmology and astrophysics, and it is the largest suite of cosmological (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations designed to train machine learning algorithms. CAMELS contains thousands of different cosmological and astrophysical models by way of varying \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, and four parameters controlling stellar and AGN feedback, following the evolution of more than 100 billion particles and fluid elements over a combined volume of \$(400\textasciitilde h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\})\^3\$. We describe the simulations in detail and characterize the large range of conditions represented in terms of the matter power spectrum, cosmic star formation rate density, galaxy stellar mass function, halo baryon fractions, and several galaxy scaling relations. We show that the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites produce roughly similar distributions of galaxy properties over the full parameter space but significantly different halo baryon fractions and baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. This emphasizes the need for marginalizing over baryonic effects to extract the maximum amount of information from cosmological surveys. We illustrate the unique potential of CAMELS using several machine learning applications, including non-linear interpolation, parameter estimation, symbolic regression, data generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.},

Because those choices are external to the data-generating process, each choice leads to an exact symmetry, corresponding to the group of transformations that takes one possible representation to another. These are the passive symmetries; they include coordinate freedom, gauge symmetry and units covariance, all of which have led to important results in physics. Our goal is to understand the implications of passive symmetries for machine learning: Which passive symmetries play a role (e.g., permutation symmetry in graph neural networks)? What are dos and don'ts in machine learning practice? We assay conditions under which passive symmetries can be implemented as group equivariances. We also discuss links to causal modeling, and argue that the implementation of passive symmetries is particularly valuable when the goal of the learning problem is to generalize out of sample. While this paper is purely conceptual, we believe that it can have a significant impact on helping machine learning make the transition that took place for modern physics in the first half of the Twentieth century.},

Here we present a variational recurrent autoencoder neural network to encode simulated Rubin Observatory extragalactic transient events using 1\% of the PLAsTiCC dataset to train the autoencoder. Our unsupervised method uniquely works with unlabeled, real time, multivariate and aperiodic data. We rank 1,129,184 events based on an anomaly score estimated using an isolation forest. We find that our pipeline successfully ranks rarer classes of transients as more anomalous. Using simple cuts in anomaly score and uncertainty, we identify a pure (\textasciitilde 95\% pure) sample of rare transients (i.e., transients other than Type Ia, Type II and Type Ibc supernovae) including superluminous and pair-instability supernovae. Finally, our algorithm is able to identify these transients as anomalous well before peak, enabling real-time follow up studies in the era of the Rubin Observatory.},

Some of these frameworks make use of irreducible representations, some make use of higher order tensor objects, and some apply symmetry-enforcing constraints. Different physical laws obey different combinations of fundamental symmetries, but a large fraction (possibly all) of classical physics is equivariant to translation, rotation, reflection (parity), boost (relativity), and permutations. Here we show that it is simple to parameterize universally approximating polynomial functions that are equivariant under these symmetries, or under the Euclidean, Lorentz, and Poincar\textbackslash 'e groups, at any dimensionality \$d\$. The key observation is that nonlinear O(\$d\$)-equivariant (and related-group-equivariant) functions can be expressed in terms of a lightweight collection of scalars -- scalar products and scalar contractions of the scalar, vector, and tensor inputs. These results demonstrate theoretically that gauge-invariant deep learning models for classical physics with good scaling for large problems are feasible right now.},

  abstract = {Within the Halo Model of large scale structure, all matter is contained in dark matter halos. This simple yet powerful framework has been broadly applied to multiple data sets and enriched our comprehension of how matter is distributed in the Universe. In this work we extend this assumption by allowing for matter to rest not only inside halos but also within cosmic voids and in between halos and voids (which we call 'dust'). This assumption leads to additional contributions (1Void, 2Void, Halo-Void, etc.) to the predictions of correlation functions, spectra and profiles for both halos and voids. Whereas the Halo Model can only make predictions for halo quantities, the Halo Void Model extends those for void statistics and halo-void cross-correlations. We provide recipes for all new ingredients of the Halo Void (Dust) Model, such as the void abundance, linear bias and density profile and test their validity in a N-body simulation. Including voids and dust into the calculations improves the transition between the 1Halo and the 2Halo terms by up to {$\sim$} 6\%. It also eliminates the need to include low-mass structures on the normalization of large-scale terms, suggesting that halos and voids are complementary cosmic structures to effectively describe matter distribution on large scales of the Universe.},

  abstract = {Next-generation surveys will provide photometric and spectroscopic data of millions to billions of galaxies with unprecedented precision. This offers a unique chance to improve our understanding of the galaxy evolution and the unresolved nature of dark matter (DM). At galaxy scales, the density distribution of DM is strongly affected by the astrophysical feedback processes, which are difficult to fully account for in classical techniques to derive mass models. In this work, we explore the capability of supervised learning algorithms to predict the DM content of galaxies from luminous observational-like parameters, using the public catalog of the TNG100 simulation. In particular, we use Photometric, Structural and Kinematic parameters to predict the total DM mass, DM half-mass radius, DM mass inside one and two stellar half-mass radii. We adopt the coefficient of determination, \$R\^2\$, as a reference metric to evaluate the accuracy of these predictions. We find that the Photometric features alone are able to predict the total DM mass with fair accuracy, while Structural and Photometric features together are more effective to determine the DM inside the stellar half mass radius, and the DM within twice the stellar half mass radius. However, using all observational quantities together (Photometry, Structural and Kinematics) incredibly improves the overall accuracy for all DM quantities. This first test shows that Machine Learning tools are promising approaches to derive predictions of the DM in real galaxies. The next steps will be to improve observational realism of the training sets, by closely select samples which accurately reproduce the typical observed luminous scaling relations. The trained pipelines will be suitable for real galaxy data collected from the next-generation surveys like Rubin/LSST, Euclid, CSST, 4MOST, DESI, to derive, e.g., the properties of their central DM fractions.},

Mock catalogues are needed to fully exploit the potential of these surveys. Standard techniques employed to create these mock catalogs , like Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), rely on assumptions such as the baryonic properties of dark matter halos only depend on their masses. In this work, we use the state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG to show that the HI content of halos exhibits a strong dependence on their local environment. We then use machine learning techniques to show that this effect can be 1) modeled by these algorithms and 2) parametrized in the form of novel analytic equations. We provide physical explanations for this environmental effect and show that ignoring it leads to underpredic-tion of the real-space 21-cm power spectrum at k 0.05 h Mpc -1 by 10\%, which is larger than the expected precision from upcom-ing surveys on such large scales. Our methodology of combining numerical simulations with machine learning techniques is general, and opens a new direction at modeling and parametrizing the complex physics of assembly bias needed to generate accurate mocks for galaxy and line intensity mapping surveys. cosmology | machine learning | hydrodynamic simulation |},

We obtain parameter estimates that agree well with those based on the sample covariance from two thousand galaxy mock catalogs, thus validating the analytic approach and providing substantial reduction in computational cost. We also highlight a number of additional advantages of analytic covariances. First, the analysis does not suffer from sampling noise, which biases the constraints and typically requires inflating parameter error bars. Second, it allows us to study convergence of the cosmological constraints when recomputing the analytic covariances to match the best-fit power spectrum, which can be done at a negligible computational cost, unlike when using mock catalogs. These effects reduce the systematic error budget of cosmological constraints, which suggests that the analytic approach may be an important tool for upcoming high-precision galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid. Finally, we study the impact of various ingredients in the power spectrum covariance matrix and show that the non-Gaussian part, which includes the regular trispectrum and super-sample covariance, has a marginal effect (\$\textbackslash lesssim 10 \textbackslash\%\$) on the cosmological parameter error bars.

The VPF provides complementary information to standard two-point statistics in that it is sensitive to galaxy bias in the most extreme underdensities in the cosmic web. Thus, the VPF is ideal for testing whether halo occupation of galaxies depends on large-scale density, an effect known as galaxy assembly bias. We find that standard HOD model \textendash{} one parameterized by halo mass only \textendash{} fit only to the two-point function, accurately predicts the VPF. Additionally, for HOD models where density dependence is explicitly incorporated, the best-fitting models fit to the combination of the correlation function and the VPF have zero density dependence. Thus, galaxy assembly bias is not a strong source of systematic uncertainty when modelling the clustering of massive galaxies.},

However , this population of galaxies is known to under-represent the most massive galaxies, which have rich dust content and/or old stellar populations. This raises the questions of the true abundance of massive galaxies and the star-formation-rate density in the early universe. Although several massive galaxies that are invisible in the ultraviolet have recently been confirmed at early epochs 2,3,4 , most of them are extreme starbursts with star-formation rates exceeding 1000 solar masses per year, suggesting that they are unlikely to represent the bulk population of massive galaxies. Here we report submillimeter (wavelength 870 \textmu m) detections of 39 massive star-forming galaxies at z {$>$} 3, which are unseen in the spectral region from the deepest ultraviolet to the near-infrared. With a space density of about 2 \texttimes{} 10 -5 per cubic megaparsec (two orders of magnitudes higher than extreme starbursts 5) and star-formation rates of {$\sim$}200 solar masses per year, these galaxies represent the bulk population of massive galaxies that have been missed from previous surveys. They contribute a total star-formation-rate density ten times larger than that of equivalently massive ultraviolet-bright galaxies at z {$>$} 3. Residing in the most massive dark matter halos at their redshifts, they are probably the progenitors of the largest present-day galaxies in massive groups and clusters. Such a high abundance of massive and dusty galaxies in the early universe challenges our understanding of massive-galaxy formation.},

To verify this idea we obtained black hole mass estimates and X-ray data for a sample of 60 narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies that we consider to be the most promising SEAMBH candidates. We demonstrate that the distances derived by the new method for the objects in the sample get closer to the standard luminosity distances as the hard X-ray continuum gets steeper. The results allow us to analyze the requirements for using the method in future samples of active black holes and to demonstrate that the expected uncertainty, given large enough samples, can make them into a useful, new cosmological ruler.},

The extensive dynamic range provided by the zoom-in simulations allows us to assess specific aspects of dwarf galaxy evolution predicted by UNIVERSEMACHINE. In particular, although UNI-VERSEMACHINE is not constrained for dwarf galaxies with M * 10 8 M , our predicted SMHM relation is consistent with that inferred for MW satellite galaxies at z = 0 using abundance matching. However, UNI-VERSEMACHINE predicts that nearly all galaxies are actively star forming below M * {$\sim$} 10 7 M and that these systems typically form more than half of their stars at z 4, which is discrepant with the star formation histories of Local Group dwarf galaxies that favor early quenching. This indicates that the current UNIVERSEMACHINE model does not fully capture galaxy quenching physics at the low-mass end. We highlight specific improvements necessary to incorporate environmental and reionization-driven quenching for dwarf galaxies, and provide a new tool to connect dark matter accretion to star formation over the full dynamic range that hosts galaxies.},

  abstract = {Most models for the statistical connection between galaxies and their haloes ignore the possibility that galaxy properties may be correlated with halo properties other than halo mass, a phenomenon known as galaxy assembly bias. And yet, it is known that such correlations can lead to systematic errors in the interpretation of survey data that are analyzed using traditional halo occupation models. At present, the degree to which galaxy assembly bias may be present in the real Universe, and the best strategies for constraining it remain uncertain. We study the ability of several observables to constrain galaxy assembly bias from redshift survey data using the decorated halo occupation distribution (dHOD), an empirical model of the galaxy-halo connection that incorporates assembly bias. We cover an expansive set of observables, including the projected two-point correlation function w p (r p), the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal {$\increment\Sigma$}(r p), the void probability function VPF(r), the distributions of counts-in-cylinders P(N CIC), and counts-in-annuli P(N CIA), and the distribution of the ratio of counts in cylinders of different sizes P(N 2 /N 5). We find that despite the frequent use of the combination w p (r p) + {$\increment\Sigma$}(r p) in interpreting galaxy data, the count statistics, P(N CIC) and P(N CIA), are generally more efficient in constraining galaxy assembly bias when combined with w p (r p). Constraints based upon w p (r p) and {$\increment\Sigma$}(r p) share common degeneracy directions in the parameter space, while combinations of w p (r p) with the count statistics are more complementary. Therefore, we strongly suggest that count statistics should be used to complement the canonical observables in future studies of the galaxy-halo connection.},

  abstract = {We present a method for creating simulated galaxy catalogs with realistic galaxy luminosities, broadband colors, and projected clustering over large cosmic volumes. The technique, denoted ADDGALS (Adding Density Dependent GAlaxies to Lightcone Simulations), uses an empirical approach to place galaxies within lightcone outputs of cosmological simulations. It can be applied to significantly lower-resolution simulations than those required for commonly used methods such as halo occupation distributions, subhalo abundance matching, and semi-analytic models, while still accurately reproducing projected galaxy clustering statistics down to scales of r {$\sim$} 100 h-1kpc . We show that ADDGALS catalogs reproduce several statistical properties of the galaxy distribution as measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample, including galaxy number densities, observed magnitude and color distributions, as well as luminosity- and color-dependent clustering. We also compare to cluster\textendash galaxy cross correlations, where we find significant discrepancies with measurements from SDSS that are likely linked to artificial subhalo disruption in the simulations. Applications of this model to simulations of deep wide-area photometric surveys, including modeling weak-lensing statistics, photometric redshifts, and galaxy cluster finding, are presented in DeRose et al., and an application to a full cosmology analysis of Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 like data is presented in DeRose et al. We plan to publicly release a 10,313 square degree catalog constructed using ADDGALS with magnitudes appropriate for several existing and planned surveys, including SDSS, DES, VISTA, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.},

  abstract = {(abridged) We study the relation between the density profiles of dark matter halos and their mass assembly histories, using a statistical sample of halos in a high-resolution N-body simulation of the LCDM cosmology. For each halo at z=0, we identify its merger-history tree, and determine concentration parameters c\_vir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree for each halo. We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with one parameter, the formation epoch a\_c, defined when the log mass accretion rate dlogM/dloga falls below a critical value S. We find that late forming galaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that c\_vir ``observed'' at any epoch a\_o is strongly correlated with a\_c via c\_vir=c\_1*a\_o/a\_c. Scatter about this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in c\_v and a\_c, implying that the actual spread in c\_vir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed to scatter in a\_c. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of c\_v, and the scatter about the median c\_vir(M,z), using accretion histories derived from the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset between the formation times as predicted by EPS and as measured in the simulations;this new ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. The correlation found between halo concentration and mass accretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates the central density is related to the background density; when the mass infall rate slows, the central density stays approximately constant and the halo concentration just grows as R\_vir. The tight correlation demonstrated here provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.},

We confirm results that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time, and that this trend depends on halo mass. For the first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately parameterized in a simple way: b(c,M|z) = b(M|z) b(c|M/M*). The scaling between bias and concentration changes sign with the value of M/M*: high concentration (early forming) objects cluster more strongly for M {$<\sptilde$} M* while low concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-mass halos, M {$>\sptilde$} M*. We show the first explicit demonstration that host dark halo clustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) and discuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g. low surface-brightness dwarfs) should have more slowly-rising rotation curves than their clustered counterparts, and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that self calibrating richness-selected cluster samples with their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias cosmological parameter estimation.},

The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here, we define this galaxy\textendash halo connection as the multivariate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This galaxy\textendash halo connection provides a key test of physical galaxy-formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy\textendash halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy-formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10 12 M {$\odot$} , less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

These measurements are derived from far-UV transitions observed in HST/COS and Keck/HIRES spectra of background quasars within an impact parameter R {$<$} 160 kpc to the targeted galaxies.

The detection rates and column densities derived for these metal lines decrease with increasing impact parameter, a trend we interpret as a declining metal surface density profile for the CGM. A comparison of the relative column densities of adjacent ionization states indicates the gas is predominantly ionized. The large surface density in metals demands a large reservoir of metals and gas in the cool CGM (very conservatively, M\_ CGMcool {$>$} 10\^9 MSun), which likely traces a distinct density and/or temperature regime from the highly-ionized CGM traced by OVI absorption. The large dispersion in absorption strengths (including non-detections) suggests the cool CGM traces a wide range of densities or a mix of local ionizing conditions. Lastly, the kinematics inferred from the metal-line profiles are consistent with the cool CGM being bound to the dark matters halos hosting the galaxies; this gas may serve as fuel for future star-formation. Future work will leverage this dataset to provide estimates on the mass, metallicity, dynamics, and origin of the cool CGM in low-z, L* galaxies.},

  abstract = {We analyze the physical conditions of the cool, photoionized (T \$\textbackslash sim 10\^4\$ K) circumgalactic medium (CGM) using the COS-Halos suite of gas column density measurements for 44 gaseous halos within 160 kpc of \$L \textbackslash sim L\^*\$ galaxies at \$z \textbackslash sim 0.2\$. These data are well described by simple photoionization models, with the gas highly ionized (n\$\_\{\textbackslash rm HII\}\$/n\$\_\{\textbackslash rm H\} \textbackslash gtrsim 99\textbackslash\%\$) by the extragalactic ultraviolet background (EUVB). Scaling by estimates for the virial radius, R\$\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$, we show that the ionization state (tracked by the dimensionless ionization parameter, U) increases with distance from the host galaxy. The ionization parameters imply a decreasing volume density profile n\$\_\{\textbackslash rm H\}\$ = (10\$\^\{-4.2 \textbackslash pm 0.25\}\$)(R/R\$\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\})\^\{-0.8\textbackslash pm0.3\}\$. Our derived gas volume densities are several orders of magnitude lower than predictions from standard two-phase models with a cool medium in pressure equilibrium with a hot, coronal medium expected in virialized halos at this mass scale. Applying the ionization corrections to the HI column densities, we estimate a lower limit to the cool gas mass M\$\_\{\textbackslash rm CGM\}\^\{\textbackslash rm cool\} {$>$} 6.5 \textbackslash times 10\^\{10\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ for the volume within R \${$<\$$} R\$\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}\$.

The method is based on using rapid, low-resolution particle mesh simulations that accurately reproduce the large-scale dark matter density field. Particles are sampled from the density field based on their local density such that they have N-point statistics nearly equivalent to the halos resolved in high-resolution simulations, creating a set of mock halos that can be populated using halo occupation methods to create galaxy mocks for a variety of possible target classes.},

These surveys will report results on the distance scale and growth rate of perturbations through measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift-Space Distortions. It is interesting to ask: what further analyses should become routine, so as to test as-yet-unknown models of cosmic acceleration? Models which aim to explain the accelerated expansion rate of the Universe by modifications to General Relativity often invoke screening mechanisms which can imprint a non-standard density dependence on their predictions. This suggests density-dependent clustering as a 'generic' constraint. This paper argues that a density-marked correlation function provides a density-dependent statistic which is easy to compute and report and requires minimal additional infrastructure beyond what is routinely available to such survey analyses. We give one realization of this idea and study it using low order perturbation theory. We encourage groups developing modified gravity theories to see whether such statistics provide discriminatory power for their models.},

We show that extending clustering+GGL analyses from the linear regime down to {$\sim$}0.5 h-1 Mpc scales increases their constraining power considerably, even after marginalizing over a flexible model of non-linear galaxy bias. Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we construct a Taylor-expansion emulator that predicts the galaxy autocorrelation {$\xi$}gg(r) and galaxy-matter cross-correlation {$\xi$}gm(r) as a function of {$\sigma$}8, {$\Omega$}m, and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters, which are allowed to vary with large-scale environment to represent possible effects of galaxy assembly bias. We present forecasts for a fiducial case that corresponds to BOSS LOWZ galaxy clustering and SDSS-depth weak lensing (effective source density {$\sim$}0.3 arcmin-2). Using tangential shear and projected correlation function measurements over 0.5 {$\leq$} rp {$\leq$} 30 h-1 Mpc yields a 2 per cent constraint on the parameter combination {$\sigma$}8{$\Omega$}0.6m, a factor of two better than a constraint that excludes non-linear scales (rp {$>$} 2 h-1 Mpc, 4 h-1 Mpc for {$\gamma$}t, wp). Much of this improvement comes from the non-linear clustering information, which breaks degeneracies among HOD parameters. Increasing the effective source density to 3 arcmin-2 sharpens the constraint on {$\sigma$}8{$\Omega$}0.6m by a further factor of two. With robust modelling into the non-linear regime, low-redshift measurements of matter clustering at the 1-per cent level with clustering+GGL alone are well within reach of current data sets such as those provided by the Dark Energy Survey.},

Although the mathematics of the formalism is widely reproduced (DETF report, Wikipedia, etc), it is difficult to find simple examples to help the beginner. This document works through a few simple examples to emphasize the concepts. 1. Hot Dogs and Buns Consider a universe with two kinds of particles: hot dogs and buns. 1 Our model of physics is that hot dogs and buns are generally produced in pairs, but that hot dogs occasionally are produced alone in a different process. We want to know the pair production rate and the hot-dog-only production rate. The only measurements we can do are counting hot dogs and buns in a given volume of space. 2 In this example, there are two observables: number of hot dogs n h and number of buns n b. Each observable has some measurement uncertainty, {$\sigma$} h and {$\sigma$} b respectively. There are two model parameters: pair production rate (call it {$\alpha$}) and hot-dog-only rate ({$\beta$}). We can write down the model as: n h = {$\alpha$} + {$\beta$} n b = {$\alpha$} assuming that we survey a unit volume of space and a unit time. 1 I am, of course, playing off Paul Krugman's famous toy model economy with two kinds of products: hot dogs and buns. 2 If the word rate is bothersome, imagine that we can first clear the volume of any particles, and then count at some unit time later.},

Using a combined sample of 87 galaxy-scale lenses out to a lens redshift of z L {$\sim$} 0.8, we compare galaxy number counts in lines of sight toward known and newly-discovered lenses in the survey to those of a control sample consisting of random lines of sight. We also compare the local overdensity of lens galaxies to a sample of "twin" galaxies that have a similar redshift and velocity dispersion to test whether lenses lie in different environments from similar non-lens galaxies. We find that lens fields contain higher number counts of galaxies compared to the control fields, but this effect arises from the local environment of the lens. Once galaxies in the lens plane are removed, the lens lines of sight are consistent with the control sample. The local environments of the lenses are overdense compared to the control sample, and are slightly overdense compared to those of the twin sample, although the significance is marginal. There is no significant evidence of the evolution of the local overdensity of lens environments with redshift.},

In this paper, we present a kinematic analysis of the ionized gas in 2778 galaxies at z {$\sim$} 0.05 observed by Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS-IV) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). Specifically, we measure the kinematics of the [O III] {$\lambda$}5007 \AA{} emission line in each spatial element and fit multiple Gaussian components to account for possible non-gravitational motions of gas. Comparing the kinematics of the ionized gas between 308 MaNGA-selected AGNs that have been previously identified through emissionline diagnostics and sources not classified as AGN, we find that while 25 per cent of MaNGAselectedAGNshow[ OIII] componentswith emission-linewidths of{$>$}500 km s-1 in more than 10 per cent of their spaxels, only 7 per cent of MaNGA non-AGNs show a similar signature. Even the AGNs that do not show nuclear AGN photoionization signatures and that were only identified as AGN based on their larger scale photoionization signatures show similar kinematic characteristics. In addition to obscuration, another possibility is that outflow and mechanical feedback signatures are longer lived than the AGN itself. Our measurements demonstrate that high velocity gas is more prevalent in AGN compared to non-AGN and that outflow and feedback signatures in low-luminosity, low-redshift AGN may so far have been underestimated. We show that higher luminosity MaNGA-selected AGNs are able to drive larger scale outflows than lower luminosity AGN. But estimates of the kinetic coupling efficiencies are \_1 per cent and suggest that the feedback signatures probed in this paper are unlikely to have a significant impact on the AGN host galaxies. However, continuous energy injection may still heat a fraction of the cool gas and delay or suppress star formation in individual galaxies even when the AGN is weak.},

We also introduce more careful approaches for deriving a suitable covariance matrix and fitting model for galaxy correlation functions. These all aid in obtaining a more accurate measurement of the acoustic scale and its error. We validate our reconstruction, covariance matrix and fitting techniques on 160 mock catalogues derived from the LasDamas simulations in real and redshift space. We then apply these techniques to the DR7 LRG sample and find that the error on the acoustic scale decreases from {$\sim$} 3.5\% before reconstruction to {$\sim$} 1.9\% after reconstruction. This factor of 1.8 reduction in the error is equivalent to the effect of tripling the survey volume. We also see an increase in our BAO detection confidence from {$\sim$} 3{$\sigma$} to {$\sim$} 4{$\sigma$} after reconstruction with our confidence level in measuring the correct acoustic scale increasing from {$\sim$} 3{$\sigma$} to {$\sim$} 5{$\sigma$}.

The extent to which the haloes' assembly history and environment impact galaxy clustering (a.k.a. galaxy assembly bias; GAB), remains a complex and challenging problem. Using a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, we study the individual contributions of different secondary halo properties to the GAB signal. These are obtained by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass selected samples to that of shuffled samples where the galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of fixed mass and a specified secondary halo property. We explore a large range of internal halo properties and environmental measures. We find that commonly used properties like halo age or concentration amount to only 20-30 per cent of the signal, while the smoothed matter density or the tidal anisotropy can account for the full level of GAB (though care should be given to the specific definition). For the "successful" measures, we examine the occupancy variations and the associated changes in the halo occupation function parameters. These are used to create mock catalogues that reproduce the full level of GAB. Finally, we propose a practical modification of the standard halo occupation distribution model, which can be tuned to any level of assembly bias. Fitting the parameters to our semi-analytic model, we demonstrate that the corresponding mock catalogue recovers the target level of GAB as well as the occupancy variations. Our results enable producing realistic mock catalogues and directly inform theoretical modelling of assembly bias and attempts to detect it in the Universe.},

These types of mappings are crucial for constructing the mock galaxy catalogs necessary for analyses of large-scale structure. The ML techniques proposed here distinguish themselves from traditional halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling as they do not assume a prescribed relationship between halo properties and N\_gal. In addition, our ML approaches are only dependent on parent halo properties (like HOD methods), which are advantageous over subhalo-based approaches as identifying subhalos correctly is difficult. We test 2 algorithms: support vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) regression. We take galaxies and halos from the Millennium simulation and predict N\_gal by training our algorithms on the following 6 halo properties: number of particles, M\_200, \textbackslash sigma\_v, v\_max, half-mass radius and spin. For Millennium, our predicted N\_gal values have a mean-squared-error (MSE) of \textasciitilde 0.16 for both SVM and kNN. Our predictions match the overall distribution of halos reasonably well and the galaxy correlation function at large scales to \textasciitilde 5-10\%. In addition, we demonstrate a feature selection algorithm to isolate the halo parameters that are most predictive, a useful technique for understanding the mapping between halo properties and N\_gal. Lastly, we investigate these ML-based approaches in making mock catalogs for different galaxy subpopulations (e.g. blue, red, high M\_star, low M\_star). Given its non-parametric nature as well as its powerful predictive and feature selection capabilities, machine learning offers an interesting alternative for creating mock catalogs.},

  abstract = {We investigate machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting the number of galaxies (N\_gal) that occupy a halo, given the halo's properties. These types of mappings are crucial for constructing the mock galaxy catalogs necessary for analyses of large-scale structure. The ML techniques proposed here distinguish themselves from traditional halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling as they do not assume a prescribed relationship between halo properties and N\_gal. In addition, our ML approaches are only dependent on parent halo properties (like HOD methods), which are advantageous over subhalo-based approaches as identifying subhalos correctly is difficult. We test 2 algorithms: support vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) regression. We take galaxies and halos from the Millennium simulation and predict N\_gal by training our algorithms on the following 6 halo properties: number of particles, M\_200, \textbackslash sigma\_v, v\_max, half-mass radius and spin. For Millennium, our predicted N\_gal values have a mean-squared-error (MSE) of \textasciitilde 0.16 for both SVM and kNN. Our predictions match the overall distribution of halos reasonably well and the galaxy correlation function at large scales to \textasciitilde 5-10\%. In addition, we demonstrate a feature selection algorithm to isolate the halo parameters that are most predictive, a useful technique for understanding the mapping between halo properties and N\_gal. Lastly, we investigate these ML-based approaches in making mock catalogs for different galaxy subpopulations (e.g. blue, red, high M\_star, low M\_star). Given its non-parametric nature as well as its powerful predictive and feature selection capabilities, machine learning offers an interesting alternative for creating mock catalogs.},

  abstract = {Understanding the impact of halo properties beyond halo mass on the clustering of galaxies (namely galaxy assembly bias) remains a challenge for contemporary models of galaxy clustering. We explore the use of machine learning to predict the halo occupations and recover galaxy clustering and assembly bias in a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. For stellar mass selected samples, we train a random forest algorithm on the number of central and satellite galaxies in each dark matter halo. With the predicted occupations, we create mock galaxy catalogues and measure the clustering and assembly bias. Using a range of halo and environment properties, we find that the machine learning predictions of the occupancy variations with secondary properties, galaxy clustering, and assembly bias are all in excellent agreement with those of our target galaxy formation model. Internal halo properties are most important for the central galaxies prediction, while environment plays a critical role for the satellites. Our machine learning models are all provided in a usable format. We demonstrate that machine learning is a powerful tool for modelling the galaxy\textendash halo connection, and can be used to create realistic mock galaxy catalogues which accurately recover the expected occupancy variations, galaxy clustering, and galaxy assembly bias, imperative for cosmological analyses of upcoming surveys.},

Unlike these estimators, {$\omega\mathscr{l}$}(rs ) can localize most of the acoustic information into a single dip at the acoustic scale while avoiding sensitivity to the poorly constrained large-scale power (i.e., the integral constraint) through the use of a localized and compensated filter. It is also sensitive to anisotropic clustering through pair counting and does not require any binning of data.We measure the shift in the acoustic peak due to nonlinear effects using the monopole {$\omega$}0(rs ) derived from subsampled dark matter (DM) catalogs as well as from mock galaxy catalogs created via halo occupation distribution modeling. All of these are drawn from 44 realizations of 10243 particle DM simulations in a 1 h -1 Gpc box at z = 1. We compare these shifts with those obtained from the power spectrum and conclude that the results agree.We therefore expect that distance measurements obtained from {$\omega$}0(rs ) and P(k) will be consistent with each other.We also show that it is possible to extract the same amount of acoustic information by fitting over a finite range using either {$\omega$}0(rs ) or P(k) derived from equal volume surveys. \textcopyright{} 2010.

We computed the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of SDSS quasars in redshift space at 8 h-1 Mpc {$<$} s {$<$} 500 h-1 Mpc, with particular attention to its baryonic signature. Our sample consisted of 19986 quasars extracted from the SDSS Data Release 4. The redshift range of the sample is 0.72 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 2.24 (the mean redshift is z = 1.46) and the reddening-corrected i-band apparent magnitude range is 15.0 {$\leq$} mi,rc {$\leq$} 19.1. Due to the relatively low number density of the quasar sample, the bump in the power spectrum due to the baryon density, {$\Omega$}b, is not clearly visible. The effect of the baryon density is, however, to distort the overall shape of the 2PCF. The degree of distortion makes it an interesting alternate measure of the baryonic signature. Assuming a scale-independent linear bias and a spatially flat universe, we combined the observed quasar 2PCF and the predicted matter 2PCF to put constraints on {$\Omega$}b and {$\Omega\Lambda$} (the cosmological constant). Our result was fitted as 0.80 - 2.8{$\Omega$}b {$<$} {$\Omega\Lambda$} {$<$} 0.90 - 1.4{$\Omega$}b at the 2 {$\sigma$} confidence level. The ``mean'' bias parameter of our quasar sample is 1.59 {$\sigma$}8-1 (for {$\Omega$}b = 0.04 and {$\Omega\Lambda$} = 0.7), where {$\sigma$}8 is the top-hat mass fluctuation amplitude at 8 h-1 Mpc. We also estimated the corresponding bias parameter of quasars at z = 0, bQSO,Fry(0), assuming Fry's bias evolution model. For {$\Omega$}b = 0.04, {$\Omega\Lambda$} = 0.73, and {$\Omega$}d = 0.23, we found bQSO,Fry(0) = 0.54 + 0.83 {$\sigma$}8-1 which is valid for 0.6 {$<$} {$\sigma$}8 {$<$} 1.0.},

  abstract = {We use the conditional luminosity function {$\Phi$}(L|M) dL, which gives the number of galaxies with luminosities in the range L+/- d L/2 that reside in a halo of mass M, to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes. Starting from the number density of dark matter haloes predicted by current models of structure formation, we seek the form of {$\Phi$}(L|M) that reproduces the galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of the galaxy clustering strength. We test the models of {$\Phi$}(L|M) by comparing the resulting mass-to-light ratios with constraints from the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation and from galaxy clusters. A comparison between model predictions and current observations yields a number of stringent constraints on both galaxy formation and cosmology. In particular, this method can break the degeneracy between {$\Omega$}0 and the power-spectrum normalization {$\sigma$}8, inherent in current weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. For flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmogonies with {$\sigma$}8 normalized by recent weak gravitational lensing observations, the best results are obtained for {$\Omega$}0\textasciitilde{} 0.3; {$\Omega$}0{$<\sptilde$} 0.2 leads to too large galaxy correlation lengths, while {$\Omega$}0{$>\sptilde$} 0.4 gives too high mass-to-light ratios to match the observed TF relation. The best-fitting model for the {$\Lambda$}CDM concordance cosmology with {$\Omega$}0= 0.3 and {$\Omega\Lambda$}= 0.7 predicts mass-to-light ratios that are slightly too high to match the TF relation. We discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy this problem, such as small modifications of {$\sigma$}8 and the Hubble parameter with respect to the concordance values, the assumption that the Universe is dominated by warm dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and the existence of dark galaxies. We use the conditional luminosity function derived from the present data to predict several statistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local Universe. We show that roughly 50 per cent of all light is produced in haloes less massive than 2 \texttimes{} 1012h-1 Msolar. We also derive the probability distribution P(M|L) dM that a galaxy of luminosity L resides in a halo with virial masses in the range M+/- dM/2.},

We build models of quasars, galaxies, and stars with multivariate Skew-t distributions in the multi-dimensional space of relative fluxes as functions of redshift (or color for stars) and magnitude. Our selection algorithm assigns probabilities for quasars, galaxies, and stars, and simultaneously calculates photometric redshifts (photo-\$z\$) for quasar and galaxy candidates. Benchmarking on spectroscopically confirmed objects, we successfully classify (with photometry) 94.7\% of quasars, 99.3\% of galaxies, and 96.3\% of stars when all IR bands (NIR \$YJHK\$ and WISE \$W1W2\$) are available. The classification and photo-\$z\$ regression success rates decrease when fewer bands are available. Our quasar (galaxy) photo-\$z\$ quality, defined as the fraction of objects with the difference between the photo-\$z\$ \$z\_p\$ and the spectroscopic redshift \$z\_s\$, \$|\textbackslash Delta z| = |z\_s - z\_p|/(1 + z\_s)\textbackslash le 0.1\$, is 92.2\% (98.1\%) when all IR bands are available, decreasing to 72.2\% (90.0\%) using optical DES data only.

From the corresponding electromagnetic (EM) counterpart detectors for each networks, we sample the joint GW+EM detections from the probability to construct the Hubble diagram of standard sirens for 10 years detections of HLVKI, 5 years detections of ET+2CE, and 5 years of detections of LISA+Taiji, which we estimate would be available and released in the 2030s. Thus we construct a combined Hubble diagram from these ground and spaced-based detector networks to explore the expansion history of our Universe from redshift 0 to 7. We give a conservative and realistic estimation of the catalogue and Hubble diagram of GW standard sirens and their potential on studying cosmology and modified gravity theory in the 2030s. We adopt two strategies for the forecasts. One is the traditional model-fitting Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method (MCMC). The results show that the combined StS alone can constrain the Hubble constant at the precision level of 0.34\%, 1.76 times more tightly than the current most precise measurement from Planck+BAO+Pantheon. The joint StS with current EM experiments will improve the constraints of cosmological parameters significantly. The modified gravity theory can be constrained with 0.46\% error from the GW propagation. In the second strategy, we use the machine-learning nonparametric reconstruction techniques, i.e., the Gaussian process (GP) with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a comparison. GP reconstructions can give comparable results with MCMC. We anticipate more works and research on these topics.},

  abstract = {Gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes and neutron stars directly measure the luminosity distance to the merger, which, when combined with an independent measurement of the source's redshift, provides a novel probe of cosmology. The proposed next generation of ground-based GW detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will detect tens of thousands of binary neutron stars (BNSs) out to cosmological distances (\$z{$>$}2\$), beyond the peak of the star formation rate (SFR), or "cosmic noon." At these distances, it will be challenging to measure the sources' redshifts by observing electromagnetic (EM) counterparts or statistically marginalizing over a galaxy catalog. We argue that even in the absence of an EM counterpart or galaxy catalog, the BNS redshift distribution will be measured by independent observations of short gamma ray bursts (GRBs), kilonovae, and known BNS host galaxies. As a simple example, we consider the case in which the BNS rate is \textbackslash textit\{a priori\} known to follow the SFR and explore how combining this redshift distribution with measurements of GW distances can constrain cosmology and modified gravity theories. We find that \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10,000)\$ events (to be expected within a year of observation with Cosmic Explorer) would yield a sub-tenth percent measurement of the combination \$H\_0\^\{2.8\}\textbackslash Omega\_M\$ in a flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Beyond \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM, this method would enable a 5\textbackslash\% measurement of the dark energy equation of state parameter \$w\$ given a sub-percent prior measurement on \$H\_0\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\_M\$. Alternatively, fixing the background cosmology and instead probing modified GW propagation, we expect to constrain the running of the Planck mass parameter \$c\_M\$ to \$\textbackslash pm0.02\$.},

  abstract = {Cosmological simulations play an important role in the interpretation of astronomical data, in particular in comparing observed data to our theoretical expectations. However, to compare data with these simulations, the simulations in principle need to include gravity, magneto-hydrodyanmics, radiative transfer, etc. These ideal large-volume simulations (gravo-magneto-hydrodynamical) are incredibly computationally expensive which can cost tens of millions of CPU hours to run. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to map from the dark-matter-only simulation (computationally cheaper) to the galaxy distribution (from the much costlier cosmological simulation). The main challenge of this task is the high sparsity in the target galaxy distribution: space is mainly empty. We propose a cascade architecture composed of a classification filter followed by a regression procedure. We show that our result outperforms a state-of-the-art model used in the astronomical community, and provides a good trade-off between computational cost and prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {We explore three different methods based on weak lensing to extract cosmological constraints from the large-scale structure. In the first approach (method I: Seljak et. al. 2005), small-scale galaxy or cluster lensing measurements of their halo mass provide a constraint on the halo bias, which can be combined with the large-scale galaxy or cluster clustering to measure the dark matter clustering. In the second approach (method II: Baldauf et. al. 2010), large-scale galaxy clustering and large-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing each trace the large-scale dark matter clustering, and the two can be combined into a direct measurement of the dark matter clustering. These two methods can be combined into one method I+II to make use of lensing measurements on all scales. In the third approach (method III), we add abundance information to the method I, which is a version of self-calibrated cluster abundance method. We explore the statistical power of these three approaches as a function of galaxy or cluster luminosity to investigate the optimal mass range for each method and their cosmological constraining power. In the case of the SDSS, we find that the three methods give comparable constraints, but not in the same mass range: the method II works best for halos of M {$\sim$} 10 13 M{$\odot$}, typical of luminous red galaxies, and the methods I and III work best for halos of M {$\sim$} 10 14 M{$\odot$}, typical of low mass clusters. We discuss the robustness of each method against various systematics. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the future large-scale galaxy surveys and find that the cluster abundance method is not superior to the combined method I+II, both in terms of statistical power and robustness against systematic errors. The cosmic shear-shear correlation analysis in the future surveys yields constraints as strong as the combined method, but suffer from additional systematic effects. We thus advocate the combined analysis of clustering and lensing (method I+II) as a powerful alternative to other large-scale probes. Our analysis provides a guidance to observers planning large-scale galaxy surveys such as the DES, Euclid, and the LSST. PACS numbers: 98.80.-k,98.65.-r,98.80.Jk,98.62.Py},

However, the detection and imaging of 21cm-line signal are tough due to the foreground and instrumental systematics. In order to overcome these obstacles, as a new approach, we propose to take a cross correlation between observed 21cm-line data and 21cm-line images generated from the distribution of the Lyman-{$\alpha$} emitters (LAEs) through machine learning. In order to create 21cm-line maps from LAE distribution , we apply conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) trained with the results of our numerical simulations. We find that 21cm-line brightness temperature maps and the neutral fraction maps can be well reproduced at large scales. Furthermore, we show that the cross correlation is detectable at k {$<$} 0.2 Mpc -1 by combing 400 hours of MWA Phase II observation and LAE deep survey of the Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera. Our new approach of cross correlation with image construction using the cGAN can not only boost the detectability of EoR 21cm-line signal but also allow us to estimate the 21cm-line auto-power spectrum.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the physical properties of accretion disks in active galactic nuclei are important for better understanding the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes. We present the accretion disk sizes of 22 quasars from continuum reverberation mapping with data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) standard-star fields and the supernova C fields. We construct continuum light curves with the griz photometry that span five seasons of DES observations. These data sample the time variability of the quasars with a cadence as short as 1 day, which corresponds to a rest-frame cadence that is a factor of a few higher than most previous work. We derive time lags between bands with both JAVELIN and the interpolated cross-correlation function method and fit for accretion disk sizes using the JAVELIN thin-disk model. These new measurements include disks around black holes with masses as small as {$\sim$}107 Me, which have equivalent sizes at 2500 \AA{} as small as {$\sim$}0.1 lt-day in the rest frame. We find that most objects have accretion disk sizes consistent with the prediction of the standard thin-disk model when we take disk variability into account. We have also simulated the expected yield of accretion disk measurements under various observational scenarios for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Deep Drilling Fields. We find that the number of disk measurements would increase significantly if the default cadence is changed from 3 days to 2 days or 1 day.},

  abstract = {We propose a flexible method for estimating luminosity functions (LFs) based on kernel density estimation (KDE), the most popular nonparametric density estimation approach developed in modern statistics, to overcome issues surrounding binning of LFs. One challenge in applying KDE to LFs is how to treat the boundary bias problem, since astronomical surveys usually obtain truncated samples predominantly due to the flux-density limits of surveys. We use two solutions, the transformation KDE method (\$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash phi\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{t\}\}\$), and the transformation-reflection KDE method (\$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash phi\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{tr\}\}\$) to reduce the boundary bias. We develop a new likelihood cross-validation criterion for selecting optimal bandwidths, based on which, the posterior probability distribution of bandwidth and transformation parameters for \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash phi\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{t\}\}\$ and \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash phi\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{tr\}\}\$ are derived within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure. The simulation result shows that \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash phi\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{t\}\}\$ and \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash phi\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{tr\}\}\$ perform better than the traditional binned method, especially in the sparse data regime around the flux-limit of a survey or at the bright-end of the LF. To further improve the performance of our KDE methods, we develop the transformation-reflection adaptive KDE approach (\$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash phi\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{tra\}\}\$). Monte Carlo simulations suggest that it has a good stability and reliability in performance, and is around an order of magnitude more accurate than using the binned method. By applying our adaptive KDE method to a quasar sample, we find that it achieves estimates comparable to the rigorous determination by a previous work, while making far fewer assumptions about the LF. The KDE method we develop has the advantages of both parametric and non-parametric methods.},

  abstract = {Building accurate and flexible galaxy-halo connection models is crucial in modelling galaxy clustering on non-linear scales. Recent studies have found that halo concentration by itself cannot capture the full galaxy assembly bias effect and that the local environment of the halo can be an excellent indicator of galaxy assembly bias. In this paper, we propose an extended halo occupation distribution (HOD) model that includes both a concentration-based assembly bias term and an environment-based assembly bias term. We use this model to achieve a good fit ({$\chi$}2/degrees of freedom = 1.35) on the 2D redshift-space two-point correlation function (2PCF) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS galaxy sample. We find that the inclusion of both assembly bias terms is strongly favoured by the data and the standard five-parameter HOD model is strongly rejected. More interestingly, the redshift-space 2PCF drives the assembly bias parameters in a way that preferentially assigns galaxies to lower mass haloes. This results in galaxy-galaxy lensing predictions that are within 1{$\sigma$} agreement with the observation, alleviating the perceived tension between galaxy clustering and lensing. We also showcase a consistent 3{$\sigma$}-5{$\sigma$} preference for a positive environment-based assembly bias that persists over variations in the fit. We speculate that the environmental dependence might be driven by underlying processes such as mergers and feedback, but might also be indicative of a larger halo boundaries such as the splashback radius. Regardless, this work highlights the importance of building flexible galaxy-halo connection models and demonstrates the extra constraining power of the redshift-space 2PCF.},

  abstract = {We present a novel simulation-based hybrid emulator approach that maximally derives cosmological and Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) information from non-linear galaxy clustering, with sufficient precision for DESI Year 1 (Y1) analysis. Our hybrid approach first samples the HOD space on a fixed cosmological simulation grid to constrain the high-likelihood region of cosmology+HOD parameter space, and then constructs the emulator within this constrained region. This approach significantly reduces the parameter volume emulated over, thus achieving much smaller emulator errors with fixed number of training points. We demonstrate that this combined with state-of-the-art simulations result in tight emulator errors comparable to expected DESI Y1 LRG sample variance. We leverage the new AbacusSummit simulations and apply our hybrid approach to CMASS non-linear galaxy clustering data. We infer constraints on \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.762\textbackslash pm0.024\$ and \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8 (z\_\{eff\} = 0.52) = 0.444\textbackslash pm0.016\$, the tightest among contemporary galaxy clustering studies. We also demonstrate that our \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ constraint is robust against secondary biases and other HOD model choices, a critical first step towards showcasing the robust cosmology information accessible in non-linear scales. We speculate that the additional statistical power of DESI Y1 should tighten the growth rate constraints by at least another 50-60\%, significantly elucidating any potential tension with Planck. We also address the "lensing is low" tension, where we find that the combined effect of a lower \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ and environment-based bias lowers the predicted lensing signal by 15\%, accounting for approximately 50\% of the discrepancy between the lensing measurement and clustering-based predictions.},

  abstract = {We search for the baryon acoustic oscillations in the projected cross-correlation function binned into transverse comoving radius between the SDSS-IV DR16 eBOSS quasars and a dense photometric sample of galaxies selected from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. We estimate the density of the photometric sample of galaxies in this redshift range to be about 2900~deg-2, which is deeper than the official DESI emission line galaxy selection, and the density of the spectroscopic sample is about 20~deg-2. In order to mitigate the systematics related to the use of different imaging surveys close to the detection limit, we use a neural network approach that accounts for complex dependences between the imaging attributes and the observed galaxy density. We find that we are limited by the depth of the imaging surveys that affects the density and purity of the photometric sample and its overlap in redshift with the quasar sample, which thus affects the performance of the method. When cross-correlating the photometric galaxies with quasars in the range 0.6 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 1.2, the cross-correlation function can provide better constraints on the comoving angular distance DM (6~per\,cent precision) compared to the constraint on the spherically averaged distance DV (9~per\,cent precision) obtained from the autocorrelation. Although not yet competitive, this technique will benefit from the arrival of deeper photometric data from upcoming surveys that will enable it to go beyond the current limitations we have identified in this work.},

We concentrate on the projected correlation function w(r\_p), which is directly related to the real space \textbackslash xi(r). The amplitude of w(r\_p) grows continuously with luminosity, rising more steeply above the characteristic luminosity L\_*. Redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. The correlation amplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but the luminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright red galaxies more strongly clustered at large scales and faint red galaxies more strongly clustered at small scales. We interpret these results using halo occupation distribution (HOD) models assuming concordance cosmological parameters. For most samples, an HOD model with two adjustable parameters fits the w(r\_p) data better than a power-law, explaining inflections at r\_p \textasciitilde{} 1-3 Mpc/h as the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes of \textbackslash xi(r). The implied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy above a luminosity threshold L grows as M\_min \textasciitilde{} L at low luminosities and more steeply above L\_*. The mass at which an average halo has one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M\_1 \textasciitilde{} 23 M\_min(L). These results imply a conditional luminosity function (at fixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a Schechter function extrapolation of the satellite population. HOD models nicely explain the joint luminosity-color dependence of w(r\_p) in terms of the color fractions of central and satellite populations as a function of halo mass. The inferred HOD properties are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions.},

  abstract = {We measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in the largest-ever galaxy redshift survey, the main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Seventh Data Release. We focus on the projected correlation function wp (rp ) of volume-limited samples, extracted from the parent sample of 700,000 galaxies over 8000 deg2, extending up to redshift of 0.25. We interpret our measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling assuming a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant). The amplitude of wp (rp ) grows slowly with luminosity for L {$<$} L* and increases sharply at higher luminosities, with a large-scale bias factor b({$>$} L) \texttimes{} ({$\sigma$}8/0.8) = 1.06 + 0.21(L/L*) 1.12, where L is the sample luminosity threshold. At fixed luminosity, redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function, a steady trend that runs through the "blue cloud" and "green valley" and continues across the "red sequence." The cross-correlation of red and blue galaxies is close to the geometric mean of their autocorrelations, dropping slightly below at rp {$<$} 1 h -1 Mpc. The luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations separately are strikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of clustering strength with luminosity, with nearly constant shape of wp (rp ). The large-scale clustering of red galaxies shows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L {$>$} 4 L *, but the lowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L *) show very strong clustering on small scales (rp {$<$} 2 h -1 Mpc). Most of the observed trends can be naturally understood within the {$\Lambda$}CDM+HOD framework. The growth of wp (rp ) for higher luminosity galaxies reflects an overall shift in the mass scale of their host dark matter halos, in particular an increase in the minimum host halo mass Mmin. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M1 {$\approx$} 17 M min(L) over most of the luminosity range, with a smaller ratio above L*. The growth and steepening of wp (rp ) for redder galaxies reflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high-mass halos instead of central systems in low-mass halos, a trend that is especially marked at low luminosities. Our extensive measurements, provided in tabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxy formation, a firm grounding of semiempirical models of the galaxy population, and new constraints on cosmological parameters from combining real-space galaxy clustering with mass-sensitive statistics such as redshift-space distortions, cluster mass-to-light ratios, and galaxy-galaxy lensing. \textcopyright{} 2011.

We analyze subsamples of halos at the extremes of these distributions and measure the occupation functions for the galaxies they host. We find distinct differences in these occupation functions. The main effect with environment is that central galaxies (and in one model also the satellites) in denser regions start populating lower-mass halos. A similar, but significantly stronger, trend exists with halo age, where early-forming halos are more likely to host central galaxies at lower halo mass. We discuss the origin of these trends and the connection to the stellar mass -- halo mass relation. We find that, at fixed halo mass, older halos and to some extent also halos in dense environments tend to host more massive galaxies. Additionally, we see a reverse trend for the satellite galaxies occupation where early-forming halos have fewer satellites, likely due to having more time for them to merge with the central galaxy. We describe these occupancy variations also in terms of the changes in the occupation function parameters, which can aid in constructing realistic mock galaxy catalogs. Finally, we study the corresponding galaxy auto- and cross-correlation functions of the different samples and elucidate the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering. Our results can inform theoretical models of assembly bias and attempts to detect it in the real universe.},

As Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are able to model the complex high-dimensional distributions of real-world data, they offer a promising approach to address this challenge. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection method, Adversarially Learned Anomaly Detection (ALAD) based on bi-directional GANs, that derives adversarially learned features for the anomaly detection task. ALAD then uses reconstruction errors based on these adversarially learned features to determine if a data sample is anomalous. ALAD builds on recent advances to ensure data-space and latent-space cycle-consistencies and stabilize GAN training, which results in significantly improved anomaly detection performance. ALAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of image and tabular datasets while being several hundred-fold faster at test time than the only published GAN-based method.},

  abstract = {Methods that exploit galaxy clustering to constrain the galaxy-halo relationship, such as the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and conditional luminosity function (CLF), assume halo mass alone suffices to determine a halo's galaxy content. Yet, halo clustering strength depends upon properties other than mass, such as formation time, an effect known as assembly bias. If galaxy characteristics are correlated with these auxiliary halo properties, the basic assumption of standard HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for assembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation statistics. We construct realistic mock galaxy catalogues that exhibit assembly bias as well as companion mock catalogues with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit HODs to the galaxy clustering in each catalogue. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs describe the true HODs well, validating the methodology. However, in all cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs exhibit significant systematic errors. We conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy clustering is subject to significant systematic errors induced by assembly bias. Efforts to model and/or constrain assembly bias should be priorities as assembly bias is a threatening source of systematic error in galaxy evolution and precision cosmology studies. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

The resulting model coupled with a dust attenuation model, can reproduce the current observations, including the H\,{$\alpha$} luminosity function from HiZELS and number density from WISP. We extrapolate the model prediction to higher redshift and the result is found to be consistent with previous investigations. We then use the same galaxy formation model to predict the number counts for [O\,iii] emitting galaxies. The result provides further validation of our galaxy formation model and dust model. We present number counts of H\,{$\alpha$} and [O\,iii] emission line galaxies for three different line flux limits: 5~\texttimes ~10-17erg\,s-1\,cm-2, 1~\texttimes ~10-16\,erg\,s-1\,cm-2 (6.5{$\sigma$} nominal depth for WFIRST GRS), and 2~\texttimes ~10-16\,erg\,s-1\,cm-2 (3.5{$\sigma$} depth of Euclid GRS).

Finally, we compare the flux ratio of H\,{$\alpha$}/[O\,iii] within the redshift range of 0 \&lt; z \&lt; 3.

  abstract = {We investigate the possibility of detecting in redshift surveys a hemispherical power asymmetry similar to that first reported in CMB observations. We assume the hemispherical asymmetry arises from a linear gradient in comoving coordinates in the perturbation amplitude. We predict the resulting clustering of galaxy or galaxy cluster tracers using an excursion set approach; doing so accounts for the variation of both the underlying clustering and the tracer bias. Based on the predicted variation of the clustering of tracers, we perform a Fisher matrix forecast of the galaxy clustering amplitude and calculate the statistical significance for ideal surveys and planned surveys. The results indicate that the DESI galaxy survey would be able to detect this signal with higher than \$3\textbackslash sigma\$ significance if the asymmetry does exist. We also investigate the amplitude and scale dependence of the above result. The DESI galaxy survey can probe the dipole amplitude higher than 0.04, which correspond to a \$\textbackslash pm4\textbackslash\%\$ difference of the temperature fluctuation along and opposite the dipole direction, at least at the \$2\textbackslash sigma\$ level. Additionally, we investigate a modulation of the power spectrum that exhibits asymmetry only for large scales. This modulation is potentially detectable. For Milky Way galaxy mass tracers, the scale-dependent modulation yields a larger change in the large scale power spectrum than does a scale-independent modulation, because the former does not alter the bias.},

  abstract = {We analyze clustering measurements of BOSS galaxies using a simulation-based emulator of two-point statistics. We focus on the monopole and quadrupole of the redshift-space correlation function, and the projected correlation function, at scales of 0.1 {$\sim$} 60 h -1 Mpc. Although our simulations are based on wCDM with general relativity (GR), we include a scaling parameter of the halo velocity field, {$\gamma$} f , defined as the amplitude of the halo velocity field relative to the GR prediction. We divide the BOSS data into three redshift bins. After marginalizing over other cosmological parameters, galaxy bias parameters, and the velocity scaling parameter, we find f {$\sigma$} 8 (z = 0.25) = 0.404 {$\pm$} 0.03, f {$\sigma$} 8 (z = 0.4) = 0.444 {$\pm$} 0.025 and f {$\sigma$} 8 (z = 0.55) = 0.385 {$\pm$} 0.019. Compared with Planck observations using a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model, our results are lower by 2.29{$\sigma$}, 1.3{$\sigma$} and 4.58{$\sigma$} respectively. These results are consistent with other recent simulation-based results at non-linear scales, including weak lensing measurements of BOSS LOWZ galaxies, two-point clustering of eBOSS LRGs, and an independent clustering analysis of BOSS LOWZ. All these results are generally consistent with a combination of {$\gamma$} 1/2 f {$\sigma$} 8 {$\approx$} 0.75. We note, however, that the BOSS data is well fit assuming GR, i.e. {$\gamma$} f = 1. We cannot rule out an unknown systematic error in the galaxy bias model at non-linear scales, but near-future data and modeling will enhance our understanding of the galaxy-halo connection, and provide a strong test of new physics beyond the standard model.},

  abstract = {After calibrating the predictions of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure against several sets of simulations, as well as implementing a new method to assert the scale cut of the theory without the use of any simulation, we analyze the Full Shape of the BOSS Correlation Function. Imposing a prior from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the baryon density, we are able to measure all the parameters in \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM + massive neutrinos in normal hierarchy, except for the total neutrino mass, which is just bounded. When combining the BOSS Full Shape with the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from BOSS, 6DF/MGS and eBOSS, we determine the present day Hubble constant, \$H\_0\$, the present matter fraction, \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$, the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum, \$A\_s\$, and the tilt of the primordial power spectrum, \$n\_s\$, to \$1.4 \textbackslash\%, 4.5 \textbackslash\%, 23.5\textbackslash\%\$ and \$7.6\textbackslash\%\$ precision, respectively, at \$68 \textbackslash\%\$-confidence level, finding \$H\_0=68.19 \textbackslash pm 0.99\$ (km/s)/Mpc, \$\textbackslash Omega\_m=0.309\textbackslash pm 0.014\$, \$\textbackslash ln (10\^\{10\}A\_\{s \})=3.12\^\{+0.21\}\_\{-0.26\}\$ and \$n\_s=0.963\^\{+0.062\}\_\{-0.085\}\$, and we bound the total neutrino mass to \$0.87 \textbackslash, \textbackslash textrm\{eV\}\$ at \$95 \textbackslash\%\$-confidence level. These constraints are fully consistent with Planck results and the ones obtained from BOSS power spectrum analysis. In particular, we find no tension in \$H\_0\$ or \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ with Planck measurements, finding consistency at \$1.2\textbackslash sigma\$ and \$0.6\textbackslash sigma\$, respectively.},

Then three classifiers based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are created in the three redshift ranges. Finally k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) approach is applied on the three samples to predict photometric redshifts of quasars with multiwavelength photometric data. We compare the performance with different input patterns by ELM-KNN with that only by kNN. The experimental results show that ELM-KNN is feasible and superior to kNN (e.g. rms is 0.0751 vs. 0.2626 for SDSS sample), in other words, the ensemble method has the potential to increase regressor performance beyond the level reached by an individual regressor alone and will be a good choice when facing much more complex data.},

  abstract = {We present the first results from the ongoing LAGER project (Lyman Alpha Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization), which is the largest narrowband survey for z {$\sim$} 7 galaxies to date. Using a specially built narrowband filter NB964 for the superb large-area Dark-Energy Camera (DECam) on the NOAO/CTIO 4m Blanco telescope, LAGER has collected 34 hours NB964 narrowband imaging data in the 3 deg 2 COSMOS field. We have identified 23 Lyman Alpha Emitter (LAE) candidates at z = 6.9 in the central 2-deg 2 region, where DECam and public COSMOS multi-band images exist. The resulting luminosity function can be described as a Schechter function modified by a significant excess at the bright end (4 galaxies with L Ly{$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 10 43.4{$\pm$}0.2 erg s -1). The number density at L Ly{$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 10 43.4{$\pm$}0.2 erg s -1 is little changed from z = 6.6, while at fainter L Ly{$\alpha$} it is substantially reduced. Overall, we see a fourfold reduction in Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity density from z = 5.7 to 6.9. Combined with a more modest evolution of the continuum UV luminosity density, this suggests a factor of {$\sim$} 3 suppression of Ly{$\alpha$} by radiative transfer through the z {$\sim$} 7 intergalactic medium (IGM). It indicates an IGM neutral fraction x HI {$\sim$} 0.4-0.6 (assuming Ly{$\alpha$} velocity offsets of 100-200 km s -1). The changing shape of the Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity function between z 6.6 and z = 6.9 supports the hypothesis of ionized bubbles in a patchy reionization at z {$\sim$} 7.},

  abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and a semi-analytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more specifically to the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation function {$<$}N{$>$} for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites, and that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with M1 \textasciitilde{} 14 Mmin (SPH) or M1 \textasciitilde{} 18 Mmin (SA). The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M \textasciitilde{} 10 Mmin where halos are too massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. We show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central galaxies produce a "bump" at high masses. We suggest parameterizations for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},
